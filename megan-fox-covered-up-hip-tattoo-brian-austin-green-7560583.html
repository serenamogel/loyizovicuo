In the snap, Fox posed pantsless in nothing but an itty-bitty black long-sleeve crop top to show off the new art in question: a black-and-white snake surrounded by bunches of flowers that spanned several inches on the A-lister’s pelvis.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Coverup tattoo for @meganfox 🐍,” Krydick captioned the post. “Was able to completely hide the old tattoo underneath the new snake and flowers she wanted… very grateful for all of the opportunity tattooing has given me and all of the cool people I’ve met along the way ✌️Thanks for your trust @meganfox ✨”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox reportedly first debuted the original “Brian” name tattoo back in 2015 to honor her then-husband, with whom she shares three sons, before later filing for divorce in 2020. The actress later began dating her current fiancé, Machine Gun Kelly (born Colson Baker), in that same year, and has gotten multiple tattoos that are believed to be tributes to Kelly — including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>matching ring finger tattoos</a> that the pair debuted in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6emqZdm7y5ecKorZ6qlZl6tryMoaCpZaSWwbW7zmaZq6GRo3qiwdKtoKdll6eyprqMcGxvaGVtgA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./35351-20-hottest-women-html.html><span>←</span><span>20 of the hottest women in the world</span></a>
