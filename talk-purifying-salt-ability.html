Purifying Salt reduces the damage of Ghost-type moves and prevents the Pokémon from receiving status ailments. Lick is a physical Ghost-type move that has a chance to Paralyze, meaning this ability explicitly minimizes the impact of the move without being outright immune to it. I think given that this line of Pokémon are partially inspired by <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>salt licks</a>, this is intentional use of game-mechanics to inform world-building of the line not minding being licked all that much (which would be ideal for a salt lick Pokémon). This is not to say its current trivia isn't accurate, just that Purifying Salt likely has more direct inspirations than just the spirit-cleansing properties of salt. Trivia should be added to either Purifying Salt's page or each of the Garganacl line's pages pointing out this explicit connection between Purifying Salt and Lick. <a href=# class=new title="User:GodRobertsCousin (page does not exist)">GodRobertsCousin</a> (<a href=# class=new title="User talk:GodRobertsCousin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:13, 7 February 2023 (UTC)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4murbeZiayroZautq%2BzvoyYpayPXY6jtcuiq7Jh</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melissa-bring-net-worth-230778.html><span>←</span><span>Melissa Bring Net Worth</span></a>
