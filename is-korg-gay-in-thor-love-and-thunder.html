Alongside that is the exploration of romance and sexuality for other heroes.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>It is revealed at the beginning of the film that Korg’s species, Kronans, procreates with two males of the species, with them joining hands inside a lava pit for forty days until they produce a child. After Korg, Thor, Mighty Thor, and Valkyrie save the universe from Gorr, they all go their seperate ways back into romance and love.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>For Korg, we find out that he’s fallen in love with a fellow Kronan named Dwayne (good joke), with them shown to be procreating as the film ends. It makes Korg just the second named male character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be confirmed gay — with the only other canon character being Phastos in Eternals.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Korg gay in Marvel Comics?</h2><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Korg was first introduced to Marvel in 1963, making his debut in Journey into Mystery #83, however this was a retcon. Truthfully, his first meaningful appearances came during World War Hulk and Planet Hulk, with him fighting as a warrior in the Sakaar arena.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>The character is indeed gay in the original source material, with Korg in a relationship with Hiroium, a fellow warrior stuck on Sakaar. Hiroium is not a fellow Kronan, but instead a local Sakaaran.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false>Korg’s parents in Love and Thunder are faithful to the comics, with the rock warrior indeed having two Kronan fathers.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=125 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Korg will undoubtedly appear in future Marvel projects, with Taika Waititi also voicing the character in the first season of What If…? And isn’t this another marvelous win for LGBTQ+ representation?</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Thor: Love and Thunder is currently in cinemas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlm6S%2FqHnGmrBmoZ5iwam70WajqK6VYq6vsIytn66mlJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-a-building-425-east-13th-street.html><span>←</span><span>The A Building, 425 East 13th Street, NYC - Condo Apartments</span></a>
