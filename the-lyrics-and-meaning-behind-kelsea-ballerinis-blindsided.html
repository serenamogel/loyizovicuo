In “Blindsided,” Ballerini details all of the problems that were wrong in her relationship, wondering how her partner did not see them.</p><p>In the song’s hook, Ballerini wonders if her partner was truly “blindsided” by the split or “just blind.”</p><p>“I’d go write a song, and you’d go for a walk/ We had to get drunk to ever really talk/ I told you what I needed, didn’t have to rеad my mind/ So, were you blindsided or wеre you just blind?” Ballerini sings in the second verse of “Blindsided.”</p><p>In the song’s chorus, Ballerini sings, “And now you’re saying that you’re lost, and that’s lost on me/ You didn’t ever wanna leave the house, I didn’t want a family/ I know the truth is hard to hear, but it wasn’t hard to find/ Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 id=h-kelsea-ballerini-co-wrote-the-song-blindsided>Kelsea Ballerini co-wrote the song ‘Blindsided’</h2><p>Rolling Up the Welcome Mat has six tracks.

This is the deep dive into that turmoil. I was writing by myself for most of the project, and it was nice to trust myself again,” Ballerini said.</p><p>She continued, “These are six songs I wish I had last year. It’s about the complexities of the feelings you go through during a massive shift at a young age.&nbsp;Rolling Up the Welcome Mat&nbsp;was how I processed everything. It’s the way I got my feelings out of my body and heart and put them to music — which is the purest way I could’ve handled it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZ%2BeZZyuv6qv0maYp5xdorKiusinnmaalZ22r7CMpJylq5WWeqOty6Wcq6GensBursuipZ2rmZmypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-post-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Post Net Worth 2024</span></a>
