While Gojo’s powers are touched upon in the show, fans may be curious exactly what these are, and why he chooses to cover his eyes."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Because of the powers these provide in highlighting cursed energy, it can often be too much to see all of the time. Using a blindfold allows him to rest his eyes.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>The Six Eyes is one of the most powerful bloodline traits shown in Jujutsu Kaisen so far and allows its user to manage their cursed energy on another level. This paired with the Limitless ability some Gojo-clan members can use is how Gojo is able to create such a powerful domain expansion.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>Even outside of its offensive capabilities when paired with Limitless, the Six Eyes is an unmatched tool on the battlefield as it can give away positions of curse users and allow them to distinguish threats kilometers away.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=false>Right now the limits of this power aren’t known, but perhaps as the manga continues we’ll get a better idea of exactly what barriers there are. Perhaps in future episodes of the show, we will see new abilities come from the Six Eyes, but for now, Gojo is strong enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllKSytHnGqKGoZZOkw6a%2BjKGgrGWVrrK0ecinZKOtmqrBtMGMpJiiq5WjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-best-way-to-waterproof-a-deck.html><span>←</span><span>What is the best way to waterproof a deck?</span></a>
