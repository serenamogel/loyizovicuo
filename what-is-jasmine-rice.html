I could stomach most forms of chicken and beef, and I’d even sample certain types of seafood on occasion. Still, I was skeptical of most vegetables, and I simply could not abide tomatoes, eggs, or mushrooms in any form. But I was far from the pickiest of my peers—I had one friend who was revolted by cheese, and another who ate <a href=#>chicken fingers</a> five times a week. But no matter how picky you were, or how picky your child is now, there is one haloed food that is certain to please: rice.&nbsp;</p><p>Rice is plain and simple but still delicious and satisfying. And yet, it comes in many different varieties. Today, we are leaving behind the most common white and brown varieties, and instead discussing jasmine rice. But what is jasmine rice, exactly? How does it compare to other varieties? Let’s gain some knowledge about the grain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-jasmine-rice><strong>What is jasmine rice?</strong></h2><p>Jasmine rice is a long-grained version of what is known as fragrant rice or aromatic rice (basmati rice is another member of the family). It has this name due to its distinctively nutty flavor and smell. Most jasmine rice is produced in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-jasmine-rice-taste-like><strong>What does jasmine rice taste like?</strong></h2><p>As noted above, jasmine rice is part of the fragrant rice family for a reason—it packs more of an olfactory punch than other types of rice. Jasmine rice’s smell and taste are often compared to popcorn.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-jasmine-rice-gluten-free><strong>Is jasmine rice gluten free?</strong></h2><p>Yes, jasmine rice in its natural form is gluten free. In fact, apparently all rice in its natural form is gluten free! Who knew? Of course, there are many ways to prepare rice and many of them involve gluten-y ingredients, so be sure to check what else is going into the preparation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-jasmine-rice-long-grain-rice><strong>Is jasmine rice long grain rice?</strong></h2><p>Yes, jasmine rice is a form of long grain rice. If you hold up a grain of jasmine to a grain of standard brown rice, for example, you’ll notice that it’s a smidge longer, hence the name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-jasmine-rice-white-rice><strong>Is jasmine rice white rice?</strong></h2><p>As it turns out, the terms “white rice” and “brown rice” have to do with how the rice is processed, not the type of rice. White rice has had its husk, bran, and germ removed. Meanwhile, brown rice and other whole grain rice keep the bran and germ layers, which adds more nutrition. So, the most common jasmine rice you might be familiar with is a form of white rice, but it’s also available in brown, red, purple, and black varieties.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-difference-between-jasmine-rice-and-white-rice><strong>What is the difference between jasmine rice and white rice?</strong></h2><p>As I mentioned above, jasmine can actually be a form of white rice. However, if you’re referring to the typical short grain white rice that you might buy in the grocery store, there are a couple of differences.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, jasmine rice has a longer grain. It is also a form of aromatic rice, meaning that it has more scent than your typical white rice—a popcorn-like scent, to be exact. Finally, it comes in multiple colors, whereas short grain rice is usually just white or brown. However, from a nutritional perspective, these two rice types are almost identical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmoZqrnZ67pnnRopqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-truth-of-mark-and-nikki-from-90-day-fiance.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth Of Mark And Nikki From 90 Day Fiance</span></a>
