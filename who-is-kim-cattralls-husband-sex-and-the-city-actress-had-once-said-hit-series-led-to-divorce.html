<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Who was Kim Cattralls husband? Sex and the City star blamed hit show for divorce</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Ever since the reboot of 'Sex And The City' has been announced, people are more than excited. But that good news came with an unfortunate casting twist - the new show titled ‘And Just Like That…’ did not include Kim Cattrall’s popular character PR Samantha. There were a lot of speculations over her removal. But now, showrunner Michael Patrick King has given an explanation.</p><p>King said, “‘And Just Like That’ was never four. It never was on the radar as four because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Cattrall</a>, for whatever reason, didn’t want to play Samantha anymore while we were doing the [third] movie. I never thought, ‘Oh, there’s a hole I have to fill.’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Samantha</a> doesn’t not exist in their lives. The show was born of these three characters: What’s their life, and who can I bring in to inform it? Listen, I wouldn’t do this again if I wasn’t excited about the idea. And even though people think this is a franchise that they’re familiar with, there’s something new in this version. This isn’t what was; it’s what’s next.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will HBO Max revisit 'Sex And The City' without Kim Catrall? Fans say Samantha Jones was 'the sex' on the show</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Why 'Sex and the City' is an overrated drama made by men for men</a></p><p>The upcoming revival will come on HBO Max from December 9 that will include the iconic characters of Carrie Bradshaw played by Sarah <a href=# rel>Jessica Parker</a>, Charlotte York Goldenblatt played by Kristin Davis, and Miranda Hobbes played by <a href=# rel>Cynthia Nixon</a>. Park mentioned that it was not easy to convince the actress of the reboot. “We had a discussion with everybody because nobody wanted to come back and just do what they did. So, there was an enormous amount of creative discussion before we all agreed to do it. It wasn’t like, ‘Here’s the script. Yes or no?’ Especially with the family members. And I’d hear feedback, everybody had something that they wanted to make sure was new.”</p><p>‘Sex And The City’ originally aired in 1998 and went on till 2004. The series was also bootstrapped into two movies, but when the third one was in production, Cattrall initially showed interest, but later backed out, which led to its cancellation. She first told Express.co.uk: “Of course there should be a third film! I think we would all love it. I mean, what would the story be? To quote Samantha Jones 'if I worried about what every b***h said about me I wouldn't leave the house!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e31e0489-b317-4564-b09e-a4731f1a7cc0.jpg><p>But later the 65-year-old actress said on her Instagram account: “I can't [do it]. My heart isn't in it anymore. I have learned so much from Sam. She was my hero but I want to rest and not work as much as I have been doing for years. I want a less hectic life. My decision reflects where I am in my life and I can't change that without being unhappy. I hope you'll understand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ba0c7836-6798-4458-a84b-0ce06350ba80.jpg><h2 class=split>Who is Kim Cattrall’s husband?&nbsp;</h2><p>Cattrall was married to Mark Levinson from 1998 to 2004 - the same time period till ‘Sex and the City’ aired. The 74-year-old is an audio equipment designer, recording and mastering engineer, multi-instrumentalist musician, and serial entrepreneur. He is also the founder of Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Daniel Hertz S.A., Snapper Music, and the writer of a book called ‘Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/71a3e0f0-a0ee-4ed9-81c1-061bc56bfe40.jpg><p>In 2016, she told News.com.au: “It cost me my marriage, because I was never home. I was never there and my husband got lonely and upset and competitive, and it was really difficult, it was really hard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKSgpmWTlsG1vsClo6xlmKrAo63NnWSsnahirq%2BwjK2fnmWTnsG6ecCcq6udo6h6qa3DZqanm5ViwKK1w2afoqxdqLKztcSsZKWdlGLBsHnDoq2oqpOa</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-spielberg-christian-or-jewish-religion-ethnicity-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Spielberg Christian Or Jewish | Religion Ethnicity And Family</span></a>
