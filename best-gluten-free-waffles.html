That doesn’t seem like too much to ask for, right? That’s what you expect (and typically get) from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best frozen waffles</a>, but, woof, a lot of gluten free waffles just ain’t it.</p><p>We fired up the toaster and tried as many gluten free frozen waffles as we could get our hands on to find the ones that won’t ruin your morning. And, I gotta say, most of them are not what I would want to start my day with. We’ve liked some of their other products, but Birch Benders grain-free waffles tasted like “animal food,” as Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> put it. Popular GF brand Vans isn’t nailing it either—their waffles have that alternative-flour flavor that just sort of ruins the experience. Would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">butter</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">syrup</a> cover it up to some extent? Probably. But what if you want to eat it plain or with something like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peanut butter</a>?</p><p>Look. I’m sure GF folks have to temper their expectations to some extent when they’re setting out to eat foods that are typically made with wheat flour, but I think brands should try harder because GF people deserve better. A lot of these products are more expensive than their wheat-flour counterparts—they should at least taste good! Anyway, during our taste test, I found only one brand of waffle that I feel like I can recommend to you in good conscience. If you have a go-to brand, shout it out in the comments (without shouting at me, thanks). Otherwise, these are the best gluten free waffles we tried.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="full circle market gluten free plain waffles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST_GLUTEN_FREE_WAFFLES_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Plain</p><strong>Full Circle Market Homestyle Gluten-Free Waffles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I’m telling you, if I wasn’t aware that these Full Circle Market waffles were gluten free, I wouldn’t have been able to guess it. They aren’t quite as fluffy as the Eggos you grew up on, but they make up for it by having an excellent fresh taste with no trace of that GF flavor that ruins other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gluten free bread</a> (and bread-like) products. They’re a perfect vehicle for butter and syrup and they don’t have an unpleasant aftertaste. We got our Full Circle Market gluten free frozen waffles at Smart & Final, but if you go to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their website</a>, you can see all the grocery chains where they’re sold.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="full circle market gluten free blueberry waffles" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BEST_GLUTEN_FREE_WAFFLES_INSET_01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Beset of the Best</p><strong>Full Circle Market Blueberry Gluten-Free Waffles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>First let me say, if you don’t like blueberry waffles, maybe try them again. If you definitely don’t like blueberry waffles, then buy the plain Full Circle Market waffles I just talked about. Go! Right now! Okay, but if you, like me, absolutely love the pleasant, fruity flavor of a blueberry-tinged waffle, bagel, or muffin, you’re going to freak for these, the best gluten free frozen waffles we tasted. They taste like real blueberries instead of alternative flours (these are made from brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, vegetable out, and some potato flour). They’re crispy on the outside and not super fluffy on the inside, but totally serviceable. Smear some butter or margarine on these, and you’re in business. Add syrup and you’re in berry waffle heaven.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFus8uuq56mXZu%2FprGMsJifnpyawHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gina-philips.html><span>←</span><span>Amparo Barcia Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
