There's more Prince Valiant and King Arthur than "Quest for Fire."&nbsp;
And Conan is defined a little differently, too. He doesn't take himself as seriously. He's not just a muscle-bound superman, but a superstitious half-savage who gets very nervous in the presence of magic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays Conan again, does an interesting job of defining his pop hero: Like James Bond, Conan now stands a little aside from the incessant action around him, and observes it with a bit of relish.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jack Black could win an Oscar for Peaches from The Super Mario Bros.
