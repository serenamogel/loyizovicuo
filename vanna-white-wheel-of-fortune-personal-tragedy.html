After years as a struggling actress, landing bit roles in films like 1980’s Gypsy Angel and 1981’s Graduation Day, she rose out of a crowd of 200 applicants to take over letter-turning duties from former hostess Susan Stafford in 1982.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“They narrowed it down to me and one other girl, who happened to be a very good friend of mine, who’s now a successful writer,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/vanna-white-dishes-on-wheel-of-fortunes-lasting-success-playboy-regrets data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="White told Fox News" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">White told Fox News</a>. “I found out I got it the day before Thanksgiving 1982 and it was one of the happiest days of my life. I was sitting in my apartment when I suddenly got a phone call. I think I literally screamed out loud.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her instant connection with host Pat Sajak, which she said the show’s creator Merv Griffin described as “brotherly and sisterly chemistry,” helped propel the Wheel of Fortune to mass success.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1986, the show was bringing in $100 million a year and on a ratings high with 30 million viewers, twice as many as the next highest syndicated show, M*A*S*H. And that same year, she was getting ready to marry longtime boyfriend Josh Gibson, who was a stripper, carpenter, sculptor and appeared on The Young and the Restless.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But her world came tumbling down when Gibson’s single-engine Trinidad TB20, built in France, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/d892ff9fc998d1bbf7ff9eed46eee221 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="crashed during its final approach" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">crashed during its final approach</a> to Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley.

It’s so hard, but you just have to think, 'What would they want me to do?’ I’m a Christian and have always had my own personal relationship with God. I don’t preach about it — because everyone’s entitled to their own beliefs — but I pray. I pray every day.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And there was a light at the end of the tunnel. "The good news is [that] I was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children," the mother to son Niko, born in 1994, and daughter Gigi, born in 1997, said. (Pietro and White divorced in 2002.)</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Her game show 'family' has never left her side</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite some roadblocks, White has continued to power through and achieve new milestones — she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in April 2006 and filmed her 7,000th episode of Wheel of Fortune on May 10, 2019.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She also earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for clapping as she applauds an average of 600 times per show, adding up to 28,000 claps a season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And through it all, her Wheel of Fortune support system has been by her side. “We’re one big family,” she says. “It’s wonderful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVorZqmnpZ6uLTIrZxmr5iasq15zp9kn6eiqcKvsYypnKurn6OurXnTq5ignZSu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-markiplier-make-on-youtube.html><span>←</span><span>YouTuber Markiplier is astounded by how much money he makes on YouTube</span></a>
