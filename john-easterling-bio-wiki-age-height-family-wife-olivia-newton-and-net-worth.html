However, he eventually left the corps in search of adventure and traveled to South America. He soon began dealing in rare minerals and stones such as roses, mountain crystals, opals, and so on. A few years after his first voyage, he began his first real excavation.</p><p>He discovered some pre-art works and textiles by Columbus, which he later sold to museums and collectors. Easterling had hepatitis and was on the verge of death in 1980. He returned to work after recovering.</p><p>He was riding a motor canoe down a stream in 1990 when he began to feel ill. As a result, he turned around. Easterling made it to a small village despite being completely exhausted but collapsed there.</p><p>Fortunately, the tribe that lived in the village welcomed him. Easterling stayed in the village for three days while the villagers nursed him back to health. They served him a special herbal tea, among other things.</p><p>His condition significantly improved after he began drinking the tea on a regular basis. His chronic physical pain and mental fatigue were significantly reduced. He soon realized that the true treasure was precious herbs.</p><p>Soon after, Easterling met Dr. Nicole Maxwell, a scientist who had been looking for Amazon herbs for over forty years. He joined him on the journey, and their collaboration resulted in the establishment of the Amazon Herb Company in 1990.</p><p>The company, which has its headquarters in Jupiter, Florida, also owns plantations in the Amazon region. It is involved in the production and marketing of herbs, cosmetics, and herbal products.</p><p>The company abides by the rules and laws governing environmental conservation and sustainable development.
