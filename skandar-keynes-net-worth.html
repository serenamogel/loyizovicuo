Skandar is a political advisor and former actor, perhaps best known for being a part of the “Chronicles of Narnia” film series in which he played the role of Edmund Pevensie. He was active as an actor from 2001 to 2015, but all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Skandar Keynes? As of early-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $8 million, mostly earned through a successful career in acting. He’s since forayed into a political career, and as he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Skandar Keynes Net Worth $8 million</h3><p>Keynes attended Anna Scher Theatre School from 2000 to 2005, and later went to the City of London School – during his time there, he wrote as a film critic for the school’s weekly newspaper. After matriculating, he attended Pembroke College, Cambridge where he would study Arabic and Middle Eastern History, graduating in 2014.</p><p>Skandar started his acting career in 2001which he appeared in the television documentary entitled “Queen Victoria Died in 1901 and is Still Alive Today”. Soon, more opportunities would start to open up for him, which would help increase him net worth. Two years later, he appeared in the television film “Ferrari” playing a young Enzo Ferrari, based on the bio-pic showcasing Enzo Ferrari’s rise to success. In 2005, he auditioned for a role in “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” as well as in “Nanny McPhee”. He lost the role in the latter but won the former, the fantasy film is based on a novel written by <a href=#>C. S. Lewis</a>&nbsp;and it became highly successful critically and commercially, winning numerous awards and leading to more film adaptations; he would win a CAMIE Award for his performance, but due to Skandar’s changing voice, some of his lines had to be voiced by his sister. In 2008, he reprised his role in “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian” which continued to score well in reviews as well as at the box office. The film involved a lot more action-oriented stunt work, and he was nominated for two Young Artist Awards for his performance.</p><p>In 2009, Keynes then reprised his role once more in “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader” for which he had to study diving and get a license for the underwater scenes. It is the final film in the series and is set three years after the events of the previous film. It received mixed reviews but was still successful at the box office, and he received another Young Artist Award nomination. All of these films raised his net worth significantly. In 2014, he then became a part of the audio project “The Extraordinary Adventures of G.A. Henty: In Freedom’s Cause”. It would become his final acting project, as he would then switch careers, and become an advisor to Crispin Blunt, MP.</p><p>For his personal life, not much is known about Skandar’s romantic relationships – there aren’t even any rumours. His father is author Randal Keynes, and the whole family often visits Lebanon, which Skander considers a second home.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.497354497354><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 5, 1991</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>London, England, of mixed English</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>City of London School, Pembroke College, Cambridge, University of Cambridge, Anna Scher Theatre</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Randal Keynes, Zelfa Cecil Hourani</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Soumaya Keynes</td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/skeynes1?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1342727/</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Ferrari</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=30.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=14><td>1</td><td>I prefer my character over all the others.
