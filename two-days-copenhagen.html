Ever since watching those chef-y TV shows about Rene Redzepi, I’ve wanted to go to Copenhagen. Sadly, we didn’t get into Noma (we were #1400 on the waiting list when Jack entered us 5 months ago, ha!), but we had a blast eating our way through Copenhagen nonetheless.&nbsp;We had only 2 short days to take it all in, but I think we did pretty well.

It’s a tiny vegetable-focussed restaurant that, first off, smells amazing when you walk in – like sourdough bread baking and onions roasting. It was so warm and cozy especially since we had just walked in from the cold pouring rain. (The photo below, was taken the next day when it wasn’t raining). Our dinner consisted of about 8 shareable courses – my favorites were the roasted spring onions with pistachio cream, grilled cabbage with tarragon, and the olive oil chocolate mousse. The great thing is that they can cater to special diets & allergies if you ask. Be sure to book a reservation a few days in advance.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/two-days-copenhagen/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0301.jpg&description=Two+days+in+Copenhagen")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/two-days-copenhagen/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0302.jpg&description=Two+days+in+Copenhagen")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>Day 2:</b></p><p class=p1>By popular recommendation, we had porridge for breakfast at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Grød</a> (the one in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Torvehallerne</a> market because it was closest to us). I got oatmeal with almond milk, topped with granola, fruit and dried strawberries. Jack got (the better bowl), which was topped with homemade caramel sauce, apple and roasted almonds. Afterward we took a long walk to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Copenhagen Street Food</a>, which is a giant warehouse full of tons of food trucks/stalls – there is a stall representing pretty much every cuisine of food – Indian, Moroccan, French, etc, etc, etc. I had smørrebrød (the open faced sandwiches that are everywhere in Denmark), Jack had something meaty, and afterward we walked through <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Christiana Free Town.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=p1>For lunch #2 (so much to eat, so little time), we went to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">42 Raw</a>&nbsp;since so many of you had recommended it. I had the veggie burger with vegan tarragon mayo and sweet potato fries. Although I was really wishing I had gotten one of the avocado sandwiches because they looked incredible. (I have this thing where I can’t help but look at other people’s food!)</p><p class=p1>For the rest of the afternoon, we walked around central Copenhagen and popped into the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Design Museum </a>when it looked like it was going to rain.</p><p class=p1>The highlight of our trip was a late dinner at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Relæ</a> (make a reservation in advance). We sprung for the&nbsp;8 course tasting menu (although the 4 course option would have been totally&nbsp;sufficient). It started with the most delicious sourdough bread I’ve ever eaten.&nbsp;The rest of the courses were a series of creative, seasonal vegetable dishes. Some of the most memorable were: a&nbsp;salad with pickled green strawberries, marigold and chives, cold cucumber soup with sorrel & nostrum, and these wonderful thyme roasted carrots en&nbsp;papillote with hollandaise sauce for dipping. We had organic natural wines (although I’m not sure how I feel about those, but they were interesting to try), and yogurt panna cotta for dessert.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/two-days-copenhagen/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0303-layout.jpg&description=Two+days+in+Copenhagen")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/two-days-copenhagen/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0304.jpg&description=Two+days+in+Copenhagen")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>The next day before heading to the airport:</b></p><p class=p1>We took a quick walk through the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Torvehallerne Market</a>, had a more smørrebrød at Hallernes Smørrebrød – I had one that was piled high with potatoes, cucumbers and chives, and a slice of carrot cake at Laura’s Bakery.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/two-days-copenhagen/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0166.jpg&description=Two+days+in+Copenhagen")'></span></span></p><p>Super quick trip, but we’ll be sure to go back!
