Are they in a relationship? Let us find out…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dove-Camero-1.jpg><h2>Dove Posts Photo With Veronica</h2><p>On Wednesday (April 6th), the former Disney Channel star took to Instagram to share a photo with Veronica St Clair. She is best known for her role as Riley in NBC’s La Brea, but she has also appeared in 13 Reasons Why and Unbelievable. The couple appears to be at an airport or train station in the photo, holding hands and touching their heads together.</p><p>“My girl, my world,” Dove wrote in the caption. From 8,000 miles away, I wish you a happy birthday. We’ll be together forever.”</p><h2>Are They Dating?</h2><p>The adorable birthday post has sparked speculation that the couple is dating because they appear to be very close, but this is not the case.</p><p>Dove and Veronica are simply best friends. In fact, best friends are soulmates or even sisters. We don’t know how they met, but they presumably met in show business and have since formed a strong friendship. A quick glance at their Instagram profiles reveals that they’ve known each other for years.</p><p>The actress shared a few photos from her birthday night out in April 2021, writing, “It’s my best friend’s birthday week and she’s 1/2 the world away on her big grand adventure.”</p><p>“Here are some photos of me crying on her for 30 minutes at a party full of people a few weeks ago, telling her I would die for her.” “Veronica, you are my most treasured,” she went on.</p><p>“You are the pinnacle of what a human being can aspire to be.” You are my entire world. I can’t believe you’re here. I am extremely fortunate, as is the entire world. Baby, have a wonderful birthday. “I’ll see you soon.”</p><p>Veronica has also shared photos of herself with Dove on Instagram, and it appears that their bond is unbreakable.</p><p>“Happy Birthday, my Chlo!!!” she wrote in a birthday post from 2020. To me, you are moonlight swims, Parisian sunrises, tears of joy, giant spoonfuls of tapioca pudding, and laughing very hard, very often, and sometimes at inopportune times (hehehe). “I adore you.”</p><p>“I’m literally bursting at the seams.” Tears poured from every pore. I adore you, Chloe. I am extremely proud of you. You already know how much I adore you. “We’ll be together forever,” she said in another.</p><h2>Fans Love Their Friendship</h2><p>On Twitter, fans are constantly obsessing over their friendship.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>📲 Veronica St Clair via Instagram | Dove Cameron <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Q3y1z8s2qE</a></p><p>— Dove Cameron Latam (@DoveliesLatam) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2022</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Dove Cameron</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Veronica St Clair</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYq51dmby3sYycmKadoqS7bq3NnWSvnaKku6qvwGaqrWWToa6qvoydmK2hnpx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-kingston.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Kingston Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
