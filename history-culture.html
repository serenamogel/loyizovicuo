At some point, she changed her name to Henrietta. After the death of her mother in 1924, Henrietta was sent to live with her grandfather in a log cabin that had been the slave quarters of a white ancestor’s plantation. Henrietta shared a room with her first cousin David “Day” Lacks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1935, the cousins had a son they called Lawrence. Henrietta was 14 at the time. The couple had a daughter, Elsie, in 1939 and married in 1941. Henrietta and David moved to Maryland at the urging of another cousin Fred Garret. There, they had three more children: David Jr., Deborah, and Joe. They placed their daughter Elsie, who was developmentally disabled, in the Hospital for the Negro Insane.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Cancer Diagnosis and Death " data-anchor-id=cancer-diagnosis-and-death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Cancer Diagnosis and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On February 1, 1951, Lacks went to Johns Hopkins Hospital after experiencing abnormal pain and bleeding in her abdomen. Physician Howard Jones quickly diagnosed her with cervical cancer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During her subsequent radiation treatments, doctors removed two cervical samples from Lacks without her knowledge. She continued to experience severe pain and returned to the hospital on August 8, remaining there until her death weeks later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She died at Johns Hopkins on October 4, 1951, at the age of 31.

Gey noticed an unusual quality in the cells. Unlike most cells, which survived only a few days, Lacks’ cells were far more durable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gey isolated and multiplied a specific cell, creating a cell line. He dubbed the resulting sample HeLa, derived from the name Henrietta Lacks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The HeLa strain revolutionized medical research. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/jonas-salk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jonas Salk" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jonas Salk</a> used the HeLa strain to develop the polio vaccine, sparking mass interest in the cells. As demand grew, scientists cloned the cells in 1955.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Important Health and Science Figures</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since that time, over 10,000 patents involving HeLa cells have been registered. Researchers have used the cells to study disease and to test human sensitivity to new products and substances. More recently, the cells enabled the development of COVID-19 vaccines.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2010, Johns Hopkins released a statement concerning the cervical samples that were taken from Lacks without her consent:</p>“Johns Hopkins Medicine sincerely acknowledges the contribution to advances in biomedical research made possible by Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells. It’s important to note that at the time the cells were taken from Mrs. Lacks’ tissue, the practice of obtaining informed consent from cell or tissue donors was essentially unknown among academic medical centers. Sixty years ago, there was no established practice of seeking permission to take tissue for scientific research purposes. The laboratory that received Mrs. Lacks’s cells had arranged many years earlier to obtain such cells from any patient diagnosed with cervical cancer as a way to learn more about a serious disease that took the lives of so many. Johns Hopkins never patented HeLa cells, nor did it sell them commercially or benefit in a direct financial way. Today, Johns Hopkins and other research-based medical centers consistently obtain consent from those asked to donate tissue or cells for scientific research.”<br><h2 data-node-id=25 title="'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks'" data-anchor-id=the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Lacks family learned about the HeLa cells in the 1970s. In 1973, a scientist contacted family members, seeking blood samples and other genetic materials—but inquiries from the family regarding the use of HeLa cells, and publications that included their own genetic information, were largely ignored.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The case gained new visibility in 1998, when the BBC screened an award-winning documentary on Lacks and HeLa.

John Hopkins has committed to naming a new building, scheduled for completion in 2025, after Henrietta. Morgan State University granted Lacks a posthumous honorary degree. In 2010, Dr. Roland Pattillo of Morehouse donated a headstone for Lacks’ unmarked grave.

Neither Lacks nor her family granted permission to harvest her cells, which were then cloned and sold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The California Supreme Court upheld the right to commercialize discarded tissue in the 1990 case Moore v.
