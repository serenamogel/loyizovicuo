The Silent Sea (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>This science fiction TV show sees a future version of planet Earth compromised by desertification.

The contents of the sample are unknown to the team, as that information was supposedly lost. With a healthy dose of thriller and mystery sewed into the story, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Silent Sea</a> makes for a compelling and intriguing watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Seobok: Project Clone (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=931 data-injectable=true>For fans of science fiction, Seobok: Project Clone hits the mark just as well as it does for those who enjoy philosophy.

Because this clone knows the secret to eternal life, he’s in danger of being captured by those who wish to gain his knowledge, putting the two characters in numerous dangerous situations. Despite feeling a lot like an action thriller, Seobok isn’t afraid to go deeper, posing the question of what it means to be human, and the ethics of eternal life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Silenced (2011)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>Written and directed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hwang Dong Hyuk</a> — the creator of Squid Game — Silenced portrays the atrocious crimes that went on at a school for hearing-impaired kids, who were repeatedly sexually abused by staff members over the years. Unfortunately, the film is based on real-life events, offering difficult-to-watch portrayals of sexual assault and its consequences. Raw and intense, Silenced had a significant cultural impact on South Korea, sparkling conversation about the country’s lenient laws regarding sexual crimes, and eventually leading to actual change.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (2016-2017)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Guardian: The Lonely and Great God — best known simply as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goblin</a> — is one of the most beloved TV shows in South Korea by both critics and the general public. In it, Gong Yoo plays an immortal being, doomed to watch those he cares about die while time simply passes him by. In order to end the torment of immortal life, the titular character must find the legendary Goblin’s bride, the only one who can rid him of this curse by pulling the sword from his chest. Although at times overly dramatic, Goblin is a creative and interesting watch, especially for fans of romance.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. The Age of Shadows (2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Set in the 1920s, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Age of Shadows</a> is filled to the brim with tension, exploring the consequences of the Japanese occupation of Korea. The film centers around Lee Jung Chool (Song Kang Ho), an informant responsible for dismantling the Korean resistance movement. Gong Yoo plays Kim Woo Jin, who operates an ordinary-looking antique shop, but in reality is leading a scheme to smuggle explosive equipment from Shanghai, which the resistance plans to use to take down the Japanese government. When the two meet — under false pretenses yet completely aware of each others’ identities —&nbsp; a complex psychological dance begins.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Squid Game (2021-Present)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Upon its release, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game</a> swiftly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">became a global hit</a>, being now the most popular Korean TV show of all time. Heavy on social commentary and class dynamics, this series puts its main characters in a deadly game, competing for the chance to win a monetary prize.

As a charismatic salesman who entices down-on-their-luck folks to join the game, the actor had viewers wrapped around his finger.</p><h2 id=h-1-train-to-busan-2016 data-injectable=false>1. Train to Busan (2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Many would consider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Train to Busan</a> a masterclass in filmmaking — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and they would be right</a>. With a premise that could potentially make this just another apocalyptic thriller about zombies, Train to Busan manages to defy expectations by delivering some of the most heart-wrenching, bawl-your-eyes-out emotional moments in Korean cinema.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>In the film, Gong Yoo plays Seok Woo, a divorced businessman who puts work above all else. When a viral outbreak takes over the country, Seok Woo and his daughter get stuck on a bullet train with other passengers, some of which are willing to do anything for survival.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Now that you’re slightly more familiar with Gong’s works, the only thing left to do is decide which film or series to watch first. It certainly won’t be an easy task, but in truth, there are no bad choices here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMoKann12uvLB5zKitop2jYq6vsIytrWarmKTEtHnRmqWknZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-macnaughton.html><span>←</span><span>Robert MacNaughton movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
