<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Best High Protein Frozen Meals</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The best high protein frozen meals aren’t as disappointing as you may imagine them to be. We’ve tasted a lot of diet-specific frozen meals lately, so we can tell you that some gluten-free frozen meals are pret-ty rough when it comes to texture and overall flavor. And the same goes for super low calorie frozen meals. But high protein meals are a different story. We’re talking chicken pasta, meatloaf and mashed potatoes—even a Cuban pork dish that we wouldn’t have thought would be good in a million years but actually is. (Note: In general, these are not good for you! Don’t come to the comments and yell at me about some of these being high in fat and calories! Yell at the companies!)</p><p>Now, we couldn’t possibly try every high protein meal the average grocery store stocks. We narrowed it down to meals that specifically advertise being high protein on their boxes and then narrowed it down further to meals with 20 grams of protein or more. We tried a variety of brands and styles and cuisines. This obviously isn’t an exhaustive list of the best high protein frozen meals at the grocery store, but if you’re on the hunt for frozen dinners that pack a punch of protein and actually taste good, this list is a good place to start.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="high protein frozen pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_HIGH_PROTEIN_FROZEN_DINNER_INSET_05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Treat</p><strong>Lean Cuisine Protein Kick Four Cheese Pizza (20 grams of protein)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>I’m not sure how much protein the average personal pizza has, but 20 grams sounds pretty good for bread, sauce, and cheese, right? Anyway, if you’re in the mood for pizza and don’t want it to be super fatty, this is the best high protein frozen meal we came across. A couple of things: a.) You should cook it in the oven, and b.) You should eat it immediately or it will turn into a frisbee. The sauce is a little sweet and super zesty, and although we thought it could use a little more cheese, this is a nice size and it’s plenty filling. And, like I said, it’s low fat! Only 8 grams, which is kind of great for a little <a href=#>frozen pizza</a>. This would be even better if you personalized it with some veggies (I always go for canned mushrooms and sliced onions).</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="frozen buffalo mac and cheese" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_HIGH_PROTEIN_FROZEN_DINNER_INSET_04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Junk Food</p><strong>Banquet Buffalo-Style Chicken Mac ‘N Cheese (26 grams of protein)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>This high protein frozen meal is total junk food. But, hey, if you’re in the mood for junk food that just happens to be high in protein (26 grams!), it’s pretty tasty. The best part is that it tastes like <a href=#>Buffalo sauce</a> but it doesn’t taste too much like Buffalo sauce. The macaroni is a little mushy, but overall it’s pretty tasty goop and the chicken is good.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="high protein frozen dinners" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_HIGH_PROTEIN_FROZEN_DINNER_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Lean Cuisine Protein Kick Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes (21 grams of protein)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>When we tasted and ranked <a href=#>Lean Cuisine meals</a>, this one didn’t make the cut, but I really think they must have changed the recipe. The mashed potatoes are well seasoned and chive-y, kind of like the filling inside a twice-baked potato. The meatloaf is thick, substantial, and glazed in <a href=#>ketchup</a>, plus it comes in a generous puddle of <a href=#>brown gravy</a>. This is not home cooking. I’m not going to tell you it tastes like home cooking. But it tastes good for a high protein frozen dinner—especially a low cal one.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best high protein frozen meals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_HIGH_PROTEIN_FROZEN_DINNER_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Pork</p><strong>Healthy Choice Cuban Style Pork (20 grams of protein)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>There aren’t a lot of pork-based meals in the frozen aisle. And I guess I assumed that pork is bad in the microwave. Suffice it to say, I didn’t have a lot of faith that this Healthy Choice meal would be remotely good, but it really is. It consists of bits of grilled pork atop a bed of grains, beans, greens, and other veggies. “It tastes like something you’d get from the Whole Foods buffet, but this way you aren’t paying $20 for it,” Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> said. “It’s very wholesome.” Weirdly, the pork is the best part (okay, it’s a little dry, but isn’t pork loin always a little dry). The greens are surprisingly flavorful, too. It’s the best high protein frozen meal if you want to try something totally different than you’d usually pick up.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best high protein frozen meal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_HIGH_PROTEIN_FROZEN_DINNER_INSET_011.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Zatarain’s Blackened Chicken Alfredo (21 grams of protein)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>One look at this meal and you know it isn’t low calorie—but we’re rounding up high protein frozen meals here, so just go with it. Zatarain’s Blackened Chicken Alfredo is the best high protein frozen meal we tasted by a longshot. It’s super creamy, like a <a href=#>good microwavable mac and cheese</a>, and you really taste the components in the sauce—nutty, salty cheese and yummy cream. The chicken is good, too. It isn’t weird and spongy like some microwavable meals and it’s got a touch of blackening spice coating it, which adds a little kick. Our only critique was that it could use a little more heat. C’mon Zatarains—jazz it up! Just keep a bottle from our <a href=#>best hot sauce</a> ranking close by.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other meals we tried: </strong>Healthy Choice Max Herb Lemon Chicken, Healthy Choice Tex Mex Chicken Bowl, Lean Cuisine Protein Kick Salisbury Steak, Lean Cuisine Chicken Parmesan, Lean Cuisine Chicken Enchilada Bowl, Banquet Chicken Fajita Mega Bowl, Marie Callender Red Chili Chicken Bowl</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFutMign2aooqTBprXNZp2rp6qau265xJqjrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashtin-glen-18-year-old-suspect-arrested-in-lockwood-shooting-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ashtin Glen: 18-Year-Old Suspect Arrested in Lockwood Shooting</span></a>
