During an interview on radio programme the Zach Sang Show, host Zach asked Madison if she would ever consider a romantic relationship with Justin, to which she replied: “Oh my god, no never. I just almost died (thinking about that). No, not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Like I’m signed with Justin, there’s not much more famous than him, like if I was going (to date someone for publicity) it would’ve happened if that was the case.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Kind of Cheese Is Babybel, Actually?</h2><time>Mar 12, 2024</time>

Remembering back to bagged school lunches, it wasn’t the sandwiches, soup, or cold slices of leftover pizza that were the most exciting—it was the snacks. Something as simple as a ziplock bag full of Cheez-Its or Goldfish could add some flavorful zip to the day. And what better snack than a little hunk of cheese? While string cheese was certainly a tasty option, the most attractive and enticing of the cheeses was the Babybel, the small wheel of soft dairy packaged in a distinctive red wax.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rocket Punch Members, Profiles, Ages Biographies, Heights, Real Names</h2><time>Mar 11, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../ava-movie-review-2020.html></a>
Yes, there is bloody action and plenty of it, though unfortunately it's been&nbsp;directed by Tate Taylor ("The Help") in the now-seemingly-mandatory handheld, cut-cut-cut style of post-Bourne action pictures. The only satisfying sequence is a close-quarters fight near the end&nbsp;that goes on and on&nbsp;until it becomes horrific, then exhausting, then&nbsp;funny. "I'm a bit rusty," one combatant admits, blood streaming from his face.&nbsp;
But on the other hand—and here's where "Ava"&nbsp;will lose viewers looking for the usual—the film's heart belongs to its&nbsp;non-action scenes: simply staged&nbsp;face-offs&nbsp;between Chastain's Ava, a&nbsp;recovering alcoholic and former teenaged delinquent,&nbsp;and supporting characters played&nbsp;by Geena Davis, Common, Joan&nbsp;Chen, Jess Weixler,&nbsp;John Malkovich, and other performers skilled enough to &nbsp;make words sting like&nbsp;slaps.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Can you get a tattoo at 16 in missouri</h2><time>Mar 9, 2024</time>
