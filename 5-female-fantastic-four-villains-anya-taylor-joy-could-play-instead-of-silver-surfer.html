Ask the internet, and there’s only one role she could be playing: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a gender-switched Silver Surfer</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>This is due to claims that Taylor-Joy is being eyed to play a female antagonistic role in Matt Shakman’s reboot of Marvel’s First Family, news that is following just days after it was similarly rumored that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there will be a female Silver Surfer in the film</a>. So, sure, this could well be what happens, and going by social media reactions, there’s nobody the fandom would prefer as feminine variant of Norrin Radd (Nora Radd?) than Taylor-Joy, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>There are actually a few other female characters in the Fantastic Four canon that could make for fascinating alternate roles for The Menu actress outside of the bold choice to have her be the MCU’s Silver Surfer — each of whom would have a big impact on the franchise in their own ways.</p><h2 id=h-5-medusa data-injectable=false>5. Medusa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/71E57555-826E-4852-8EAF-B6763F42E2FF.jpeg><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>Hey, Anson Mount’s Black Bolt returned — against all the odds — in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, so it’s entirely possible Marvel could reboot the Inhumans in the MCU someday. And if that was to happen anywhere it would make sense to do it in Fantastic Four as the Inhuman species debuted in the pages of FF comics. At first, Inhuman queen Medusa, with her prehensile hair, was a villain for the team, something that could be easily replicated in the upcoming 2025 movie.</p><h2 id=h-4-darkchylde data-injectable=false>4. Darkchylde</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Anya-Taylor-Joy-The-New-Mutants.jpg><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=941 data-injectable=true>Let’s not forget, though, that Taylor-Joy already has history in the Marvel multiverse — she played Illyana Rasputin/Magik in Fox’s ill-remembered The New Mutants. Given that X-Men spinoff’s poor reception, it’s unlikely Marvel would want to resurrect it in any way, but it has to be said that Taylor-Joy was perfect casting. And they just brought <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelsey Grammer back as Beast</a> after X-Men: The Last Stand, so who knows? One way to resurrect Magik would be in her demonic, villainous Darkchylde persona. Have her show up in Fantastic Four and then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pit her against Scarlet Witch</a> in Avengers: Secret Wars or something!</p><h2 id=h-3-victorious data-injectable=false>3. Victorious</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/doctor-doom-victorious-wedding.jpg><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>What’s one way of revamping Doctor Doom for the MCU to differentiate him from the Fox versions? How about giving him a bride? A recent addition in the comics, Zora Vukovic is Doom’s loyal lieutenant that he imbued with the energy of the Power Cosmic so she could become Latveria’s own superpowered champion, Victorious. The pair fell in love and were to be wed, before Zora slept with Human Torch the night before their wedding. Imagine this superhero soap opera playing out in the MCU!</p><h2 id=h-2-nova data-injectable=false>2. Nova</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nova-frankie-raye.png><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true>Talk of a female Silver Surfer has led to some wondering if we’re at crossed wires here and what’s really happening is that we’re getting another Herald of Galactus who is female. If that is the case then Frankie Raye aka Nova would be the most obvious option. As a frequent love interest to Johnny Storm, Frankie is usually an ally to the FF, but her role as one of the World Devourer’s Heralds naturally puts her at odds with the group on occasion. With her own pyro powers, she could certainly be reimagined for the MCU as an antagonist counterpart to Johnny.</p><h2 id=h-1-valeria-von-doom data-injectable=false>1. Valeria Von Doom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Valeria_Richards_29_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_581_001.jpg><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=946 data-injectable=false>With Pedro Pascal likely our Mr Fantastic, this has led to speculation that Reed and Sue Richards’ children, Franklin and Valeria, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be introduced into the MCU right away</a>. If that is the case then Taylor-Joy would be perfect as Valeria. While Franklin, perhaps <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most powerful individual on Earth-616</a>, usually grabs all the attention, his sister is an intriguing character in her own right as she was originally raised by Victor Von Doom. Fantastic Four could pull off its own Star Wars-style twist if Doom is depicted as having a daughter, only for her to pull her mask off and reveal she’s the Richards’ long-lost child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJobGaelaKurbGMn5inrJGowaqvjJ%2Bmrqpdq7atuMCipaxlkaPGonnTmrClp6Jit7DFjJymrqSUYr2trdhmoKerpJqupXnOn2SsoZyrsrN50q6pn52iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luca-movie-review-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Luca movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)</span></a>
