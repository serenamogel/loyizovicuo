Get out of here.”</p><p>Taken aback, Burt thought Milburn was trying to get rid of him.</p><p>He says he cringes over what he said next.</p><p>“I asked [Milburn], “Don’t you like me?” Gentleman that he was, he said, “I love your work. It’s time you think about your movie career.”</p><p>Reynolds said that was all it took. “I knew he was the smartest guy—I always thought that. He was so wonderful. So I quit.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>How old was Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 1</a>?</p><h2><strong>What did he do after Gunsmoke?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59076 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/who-played-quint-on-gunsmoke.jpg.webp alt="who played quint on gunsmoke" width=860 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/who-played-quint-on-gunsmoke.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59076 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>In a nutshell: a lot.</p><p>He scored his first lead role in Operation CIA, followed by Flipper, 12 O’Clock High, Hawk, and Navajo Joe.</p><p>He rose to prominence as a sex symbol and would go on to become the epitome of 1970s pop culture in the US.</p><p>Deliverance, White Lightning, The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough, and a slew of other movie leads followed—including his iconic role in Smokey and the Bandit in 1977.</p><p>Throughout his illustrious career, Burt Reynolds was voted the top box-office star for four years running, won two Golden Globe awards, and a Primetime Emmy.</p><p>Despite his success as a film superstar, Reynolds’ shared in an interview later:</p><p>“I’ve often wondered what would have happened had I stayed for the whole run [of Gunsmoke].
