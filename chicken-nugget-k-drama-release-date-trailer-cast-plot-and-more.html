On Feb. 28, Netflix dropped the first trailer for its newest Korean drama, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicken Nugget</a></strong>. The drama is set to premiere on Mar. 15 but the trailer might leave viewers with more questions than answers ahead of the first episode. Hopefully, this helps!</p><h2 id=h-wait-is-chicken-nugget-really-about-a-girl-who-turned-into-a-chicken-nugget data-injectable=false>Wait, is Chicken Nugget really about a girl who turned into a chicken nugget?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Yes, you heard correctly: Chicken Nugget‘s plot follows the owner of a company as he tries to turn his daughter back into a person after she turns into a chicken nugget. The trailer makes the show look absolutely absurd in the best way but little else is known about the plot other than what we see here. Here’s the official synopsis via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“A woman steps into an odd machine and becomes… a chicken nugget?! Now, it’s up to her father and admirer to embark on a zany quest to bring her back.”</p><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Chicken Nugget has employed an all-star cast to go along with its surreal plot. Ryu Seong-ryong (Extreme Job, Miracle in Cell No. 7) stars as Choi Seon-man, a company president on a mission to turn his daughter back into a human after transforming into the eponymous chicken nugget. Ahn Jae-hong (Reply 1988) plays Baek-joong, a company intern with a crush on Seon-man’s daughter (peep the scene of him tenderly brushing sauce on the chicken nugget). Kim Yoo-jung (My Demon) is Choi Min-ah, the daughter who becomes the infamous chicken nugget. HoYeon Jung (Squid Game) rounds out the cast as Hong Cha, a food columnist.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=false>With a cast like that and premise somewhere between Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and an SNL sketch, Chicken Nugget is shaping up to be one of the funniest shows of 2024. If you’re planning on watching, make sure to tune into Netflix on Mar. 15. Like many of the streamer’s series, all episodes of Chicken Nugget will be released on its premiere date. If you like to binge-watch shows, make sure you’re well-rested and ready to marathon before beginning your watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZpygmZi4prqMp6ygn5Wpeqx5w6uYppldp7KtscCsnGackamybsDRmqClnaJisKK%2F02anpaekYq6vsIympqudXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-jackson.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Jackson movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
