<a href=../../best-canned-corn.html></a>
The biggest surprise in our canned corn taste tests wasn‚Äôt flavor, but texture. The texture of canned corn varies wildly. The best stuff, in the opinion of Sporked, is soft yet crisp. Most canned sweet corn is overcooked, mushy, and textureless. Those didn‚Äôt make the list.
