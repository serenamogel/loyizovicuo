A stain will protect the wood and provides a more uniform tint or color to the wood to complement surrounding structures.<h2>Should you waterproof a deck?</h2>The general rule of thumb is to get your deck waterproofed once a year, especially if you live in areas that see a lot of rainfall. Another thing to consider is whether or not you live in an area that gets a lot of direct sunlight year round.<h2>Is Thompsons water seal good for decks?</h2>Thompson's® WaterSeal® Maximum Strength Deck Stripper is the strongest option and will remove any coating - even a solid stain. If your deck is made of redwood or cedar,Thompson's® WaterSeal® 3 in 1™ Wood Cleaner will help restore those wood's natural color.<h2>What is the best time of year to seal a deck?</h2>Summer is generally the best time to waterproof your deck because it gives you the opportunity to clean it thoroughly and seal it properly without worrying about rain. It takes about two to three days for a deck to completely dry out after sealing and you'll need up to six days for it to be fully functional again.<h2>How To Protect Your Deck | Never Sand Again!</h2><p></p><h2>Which is better oil based or water based deck sealer?</h2>Water-based stains require a little more time and effort than oils, but it pays off with significantly greater durability.

Water-based stains are better for cedar, cypress, and redwood as they are naturally protected from rot.<h2>Which deck stain lasts the longest?</h2>In general, an oil-based deck stain will last the longest, but it also depends on the type of wood, the weather conditions, and how long the deck has gone unprotected before staining.<h2>How long does water based stain last?</h2>Water-based stain will last 1 year, if opened, and 2 years, if unopened.
