It was amazing,” Chappelle said. Later in the discussion, he recalled how Macdonald’s hilarity on the set of their 2000 film Screwed helped him grieve the loss of his father.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Letterman, who anointed Macdonald as the last comedian to perform stand-up on his late-night show, called the special “not strictly-speaking stand-up.”(After all, Macdonald was sitting down.)</p><p>“It’s something else… The great gift could have been to be in a room full of people when Norm did that for those people.”</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Due to COVID-19 and his failing health on account of a secret cancer diagnosis, Macdonald recorded his special with a couple of cameras and a bright lamp in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">kitchen of his producing partner’s condo.</a></p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>“The audience was his partner,” Letterman lamented about Macdonald’s final, isolated special. “Everybody was in this together with Norm.”</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Sandler, with whom Macdonald worked on Saturday Night Live and several movies, took something more personal from the special.</p><p>“That kind of felt like the gentle Norm that, when you would sit and hang out after our shows on the road . . . and he’d still be being funny, he would kind of perform like that.”</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>“He had the best word choice of maybe any comedian I’ve ever seen,” added O’Brien, on whose talk show Macdonald shined brighter than arguably any other platform. “He was like Mark Twain.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Another of Macdonald’s SNL and film collaborators, David Spade marveled that the special was filmed in one take. “There’s no really looking down, there’s no bumbling . . . it was just kind of go, go, go, go,” Spade said over there on the chair.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>SNL alum number three, Shannon, remembered Macdonald’s lesser advertised attributes. “I felt like, deep down, he was very, very shy . . . and so sweet . . . and so sensitive.”</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=247 data-injectable=false>Perhaps the most poignant comment <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">came from Chappelle.</a></p><p>“This guy was, in a weird way, reconciling his mortality hilariously in front of us.”</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>You can watch the rest of their discussion, and the special that prompted it, in Norm Macdonald: Nothing Special on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9s7HTrbBmpaWYtW6ty6VkqJ5drry2voyfmK%2BdXaiutcHRnZiyZZ6etKnAjKWgr51dlrm2uYyjpqKmlZl6p7vRnJysZaSkerGt2Garq6GSqsGmedOoZKenoqJ6rq3CnaanmZyZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-mandalorians-eat-star-wars-lore-explained.html><span>←</span><span>How do Mandalorians eat?
