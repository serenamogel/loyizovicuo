Judging by this chapter’s art, the time away did him wonders. Although it doesn’t move the story along much, 408 provides the necessary context we’ve been missing for a long while, especially in regard to Yoichi, the second One for All user, and his possible connection to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katsuki Bakugo</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When and where to read chapter 408 of My Hero Academia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/my-hero-academia-deku.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Chapter 408 of My Hero Academia will be officially released in English on Dec. 3, at 9am CT.

Two months after Yoichi escapes with Kudou, the villain completely destroys his body so that only Yoichi’s hand is left intact. While the villain seems completely numb to it, watching the scene with empty eyes, Kudou, who was present then, stares at All for One with emotion, beginning to tear up.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Sometime after Yoichi’s death, the villain contemplates his brother’s severed hand and wonders why the quirk that he gave him is no longer in his body. He quickly realizes that it may have been passed down to someone else. Meanwhile, Kudou is examined by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">third One for All user</a>, who explains that there is a new quirk factor inside his body now, besides Gearshift.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=975 data-injectable=true>Readers are then treated to a double spread portraying the next decades of All for One’s life, in which he repeatedly attempted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">steal One for All</a> from its users. They were all unsuccessful, but also led to many deaths before All Might defeated him for the first time. Back to the present, the villain wonders if Bakugo and Kudou are blood-related, but quickly brushes that idea off. He had killed Kudou’s entire family alongside him, so that wasn’t possible. He then realizes that it’s Bakugo’s eyes that remind him of Kudou, and his determination to defeat him.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>All for One knows that he can’t afford to keep taking damage before getting to Shigaraki, so in a desperate final move, he activates all his quirks at once. This is the first time we see the villain do such a thing, but even confronted with it, Bakugo refuses to admit defeat.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=false>With My Hero Academia <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in its Final Act Saga</a> and heading for a conclusion, it’s time for Horikoshi to start tying up any loose ends.
