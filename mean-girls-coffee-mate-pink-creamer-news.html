Creamer giant Coffee-mate announced on Tuesday that it will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the movie Mean Girls with a pink coffee creamer that is, according to Coffee-mate, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“not a regular creamer, I’m a PINK creamer!”</a> And don’t worry, we are here to tell you everything we know. Unless you are Gretchen Wieners, that is. When it comes to info about this collab—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">none for Gretchen Wieners, bye.</a> But if you have ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">felt personally victimized</a> by having to wake up in the morning, this collab just might make the start of your day a bit brighter (or at least pinker).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-just-what-does-this-mean-girls-coffee-creamer-taste-like-can-you-only-drink-it-on-wednesdays-why-are-they-trying-to-make-pink-coffee-creamer-happen>So just what does this Mean Girls coffee creamer taste like? Can you only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drink it on Wednesdays</a>? Why are they trying to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make pink coffee creamer happen</a>?</h2><p>Turns out, Coffee-mate made this pink concoction to taste like “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a cake filled with rainbows and smiles</a>,” or in other words, it is pink frosting-flavored coffee creamer. Now you may be wishing (as I was) to ask this coffee creamer, “If you’re a coffee creamer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">why are you pink</a>?” but alas, coffee creamers don’t talk, so our only guess is that it is pink because that’s kind of Mean Girls’ whole deal. Plus, as a play on the ever-iconic line “on Wednesdays we wear pink,” Coffee-mate has assured us (the consumers) that we can enjoy this coffee creamer “on Wednesdays—and all days that end in ‘y'” (I did the math, and that is every day of the week, my friends).</p><p>So where and when can you find this pink frosting-flavored coffee creamer packaged in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cold, shiny, hard plastic</a>? Looks like while the world is ready for this coffee creamer now (happy belated Mean Girls day to those who observe), we will, unfortunately, have to wait until January 2024 to get our hands on this pink drink mix-in. But when it does drop, we know it will come in 32 fl. oz. bottles, cost roughly $4.69, and be available in retailers nationwide. I can’t wait to add it to my morning coffee and enjoy it alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a buttered muffin</a>, or add it to my hot chocolate and call <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it a Glen Cocoa</a>. And if you feel the same way, then we can all drive up to our friends’ houses come January and say, “<a href=# rel=noopener>Get in loser, we’re going shopping</a> for Coffee-mate Mean Girls Pink Frosting Flavored Creamer.” I can’t wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKWVlrtus8iro6xlk6Szp7HEZqSarJVivaq6ymaaq52RorKzec2erqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rose-langdon.html><span>←</span><span>Rose Langdon</span></a>
