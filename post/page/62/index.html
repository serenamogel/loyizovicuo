<a href=../../../how-tall-is-michael-myers.html></a>
If there’s one thing horror movies have taught us, it’s that the taller the villains, the scarier they truly seem to be. While horror characters such as the Leprechaun and Chucky are running around like little ankle-biters causing unfathomable terror, some others make unsuspecting victims stop in their tracks and marvel at their towering stances.

travel / Copenhagen
Ever since watching those chef-y TV shows about Rene Redzepi, I’ve wanted to go to Copenhagen. Sadly, we didn’t get into Noma (we were #1400 on the waiting list when Jack entered us 5 months ago, ha!), but we had a blast eating our way through Copenhagen nonetheless.&nbsp;We had only 2 short days to take it all in, but I think we did pretty well. Thanks to all of you who gave us so many amazing recommendations on Instagram!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meg Cabot Net Worth: Novels, Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</h2><time>Mar 17, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../the-untold-truth-of-mark-and-nikki-from-90-day-fiance.html></a>
Despite the large age gap and handpicking a replacement wife, fans had to give Mark Shoemaker some credit for being upfront about his reasons for marrying Nikki. Mark was looking for less of a wife and more of a mother for his kids (some older than Nikki). A point he drove home throughout Season 3 by continuously mentioning that he never imagined fatherhood as being alone with his kids. While it's unclear what exactly Mark thought raising children entailed, it is clear that he was determined to find a new wife to share the burden.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Is Jasmine Rice and Is It Different from White Rice?</h2><time>Mar 17, 2024</time>

On the “picky eater” scale, I was about a 7 out of 10 in my youth. I could stomach most forms of chicken and beef, and I’d even sample certain types of seafood on occasion. Still, I was skeptical of most vegetables, and I simply could not abide tomatoes, eggs, or mushrooms in any form. But I was far from the pickiest of my peers—I had one friend who was revolted by cheese, and another who ate chicken fingers five times a week.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Alessandro Juliani Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Mar 16, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../frantz-2017.html></a>
Based on the 1932 anti-war drama “Broken Lullaby,” itself inspired by a Maurice Rostand play whose title shall go unremarked here as it technically constitutes a spoiler, “Frantz” begins in the small German town of Quedlinburg just after the end of World War I and focuses on Anna (Paula Beer), still mourning the death of her fiancée, Frantz Hoffmeister (Anton von Lucke), on the battlefield a year earlier. One day, while visiting Frantz’s grave, she discovers a mysterious Frenchman named Adrien (Pierre Niney) has been paying his respects as well.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/61/>← Prev Page</a>
