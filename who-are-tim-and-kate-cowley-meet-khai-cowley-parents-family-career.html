Meet Khai Cowley Parents: Family &amp;amp; Career</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Tim and Kate Cowley,</strong> the parents of late surfer <strong>Khai Cowley</strong>, are going through the most difficult time of their lives.<br>The couple just lost their 15-year-old son, Khai, a well-known junior surfer in Australia. The family is in grief, with Khai’s parents witnessing the most shocking event in their lives.&nbsp;Khai Cowley was active in the surfing scene, having a family history of surfing. At a recent surfing event, his grandpa, Peter Barley, uncle, Adam Barley, and the youngster all received prizes.</p><p>As the third-generation surfer in the family, the youngster was very skilled and popular at an early age. Unfortunately, he perished on December 28, 2023, as a result of a shark attack. According to sources, Khai is the third person to die this year and the eighth person to die in a shark attack in South Australia in the last 22 years.</p><h2>Khai Cowley Parents: Who Are They?</h2><p><strong>Tim and Kate Cowley</strong>, <strong>Khai Cowley’s parents</strong>, are unable to say anything at this time. They are Australians who came to fame after the loss of their teenage son.&nbsp;While Khai’s grandpa and uncle are also surfers, his parents do not look to be in the same league.&nbsp;However, it has come to our attention that his father, Tim Cowley, also enjoys surfing. He was with his son, Khai, on Thursday at Ethel Beach on the Yorke Peninsula West in their hometown of Adelaide.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Khai-Cowley-1.jpg alt="Khai Cowley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to reports, the child died after being attacked by a large white shark while surfing. Cowley’s corpse was discovered in the ocean minutes after the assault on Ethel Beach in the Inner National Park.&nbsp;The shark bit his leg, and his father, Tim, stood there in horror. According to sources, the father-son combo went on a brief excursion together to a surfing location around 4 hours away from their home.&nbsp;Following the boy’s death, his family and loved ones remember him. Uncle Adam and the boy’s regular surfing, according to his grandfather.&nbsp;Furthermore, the surfing world recalls the late surfer as a brave and skilled young man.</p><h2>Khai Cowley Family & Professional Lives</h2><p><strong>Tim and Kate Cowley</strong>, Cowley’s parents, are not affluent. Though little information about their occupation or location has been provided, they seem to live a normal life with enough money. Lauryn Barley, the late surfer’s aunt, established a GoFundMe page to assist Khai’s parents with burial expenses. Until the 30th of December, almost 1300 contributors raised over $75 thousand.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Khai-Cowley-2.jpg alt="Khai Cowley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition, the community has agreed to hold a peddle-out event in Cowley’s name, paying respect to his life and enthusiasm for the sport.&nbsp;The Port Noarlunga Football Club also sent a sympathetic greeting to the family.
