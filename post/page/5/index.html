Bad Bunny is one lucky man.
Kendall Jenner soaked up some sun on Instagram Monday in a cheeky thong bikini from celebrity-loved label Heavy Manners.
The model looked effortlessly cool in her yellow floral two-piece, a rust-colored 818 hat and black sunglasses.
In one of the snaps, Jenner tanned her backside while laying face-down on a lawn chair.
In another pic, the 27-year-old — who has an affinity for butt-baring outfits — looked back at her perky derriére as she turned to lay on her side.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Spit On A Griddle: The Return of Francis Ford Coppolas One from the Heart | Features</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

The iPhone XS’ come with a brand-new camera module: Apple has increased the sensor size of the main camera sensor by upping the pixel pitch from 1.22µm to 1.4µm. This increases the actual area of each pixel by 48%, which means it equivalently increases the light collection capabilities of the sensor.
