Sharing the photo on Facebook, Brittney saw an outpouring of support from her friends and family by them also purchasing fries from Mickey D‚Äôs, as well as a few other restaurants.

While it‚Äôs unclear exactly where the luckiness of the fries came from, many believe it came from advice for IVF patients at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a disorder caused by excessive hormones in the reproductive system, such as those given during IVF treatments. Many patients at risk for OHSS are told by their doctors that after an IVF transfer, they should eat a high-sodium and high-protein diet to lower their risk of experiencing OHSS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/McD-Fries.jpg><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Not every person going through IVF is at risk for experiencing OHSS, so it‚Äôs unclear why the community as a whole is attached to the idea of eating sodium after a treatment. But regardless, if you go into any online forum dedicated to couples going through IVF treatment, you‚Äôll see countless mentions of post-treatment fries. Mcdonald‚Äôs is the most common post-treatment treat, but you‚Äôll still see your fair share of Chick-Fil-A, Arby‚Äôs, and In-N-Out Burger as well.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Whether or not fries have any actual medical benefits for IVF patients, this food trend is far from dying out. Plus, it‚Äôs a great way to not only get a bit of luck during a difficult time but allow friends and family to show their support uniquely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8pq3ToqWgZZantqa%2FjJ%2Bmq2WppMJur86up6Wdo2LAtrzPqKmtoaaaeqetzKKjsmWZo66lwsSrq56mpKHGbq%2FRnpitnaNiwamxjJ2cnJmUmsBursSsq2alk5m8r63Lnapmm5%2Biuqa%2BwqKYpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./divya-agarwal.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Divya Agarwal Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
