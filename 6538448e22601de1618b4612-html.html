The couple, who starred alongside Masterson in the hit show That 70s Show, have allegedly been pointing fingers at each other over who is to blame for their current predicament.</p><p>According to insiders, the couple has decided to keep a low profile in the wake of the controversy. "All the bashing they've been getting online and in the press has sent them into the bunker and now they're blaming each other," a source revealed. The leaked letters of support for Masterson, which were written by <strong>Kutcher and Kunis</strong>, have caused a firestorm of criticism for the couple.</p><p><strong>Masterson</strong> was recently sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for the rape of two women. In the aftermath of his sentencing, Kutcher, 45, and Kunis, 40, released a taped apology to address the backlash they were facing. However, a friend of the couple disclosed that they are still grappling with fears that their actions have damaged their careers.</p><p>The insider also revealed that the couple is still angry at each other for not realizing the mistake they made in defending Masterson. "Ashton thinks the best solution for them is to lie low," the source said. "But Mila says they need to get out there and make it clear they know they made a huge mistake."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Source says this is worse than a cheating scandal</h2><p>The couple's relationship has reportedly been strained by the intense criticism they have received. "Mila and Ashton have never been so universally savaged," spilled the source. "It's put an amazing strain on their relationship. In some ways, this is worse than a cheating scandal or political controversy."</p><p>Sources also mentioned that Kunis is eager to resume work on her new comedy, Goodrich, which was put on hold due to the dual Hollywood strikes. It seems that both <strong>Kutcher and Kunis</strong> are at odds with each other on how to handle the situation.</p><p>While the couple continues to face backlash and internal conflict, it remains to be seen how they will navigate their way through this challenging time. One thing is for sure, though - their support for Masterson has had far-reaching consequences on both their personal and professional lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGZraGJofHJ8jmtsaG5laIV1gJeeaWtuYGaxpn2Vam%2BbbGZmf2%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./980413-japanese-legend-announced-for-mae-young-classic-2018.html><span>←</span><span>Japanese Legend Announced For Mae Young Classic 2018</span></a>
