If you’re on TikTok, you’ve definitely seen these viral corn ribs all over your fyp. For those of you who aren’t, corn ribs are essentially slivers of corn on the cob that you can eat like a rib. These aren’t particularly appealing to me, but people seem to love them! And, as is the case with so many viral food trends, Trader Joe’s recently released its own rendition. We tried their new Seasoned Corn Ribs, and here’s our take:</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Avatar: The Way of Water movie review (2022)</h2><time>May 7, 2024</time>

Maybe not right away. "Avatar: The Way of Water" struggles to find its footing at first, throwing viewers back into the world of Pandora in a narratively clunky way. One can tell that Cameron really cares most about the world-building mid-section of this film, which is one of his greatest accomplishments, so he rushes through some of the set-ups to get to the good stuff. Before then, we catch up with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a human who is now a full-time Na'vi and partners with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), with whom he has started a family.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cannes 2021: Vortex, In Front of Your Face, Blue Bayou | Festivals &amp;amp; Awards</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>

Finally, a look at Justin Chon’s “Blue Bayou” which played in the Un Certain Regard sidebar. Korean-American filmmaker Chon is best known for his 2017 Sundance film “Gook,” set during the L.A. riots. His latest tackles several contemporary hot-button social issues, including tenuous immigration status, police violence, and the legacy of foreign adoptions. It’s a lot to cover, and all these pieces are overwhelmed by the resulting haphazard storyline. Chon plays Antonio LeBlanc, a tattoo artist looking to improve his employment situation despite having a felony record.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Daniel Sharman Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>

I was wrong. Both about the pronunciation of the title character—it’s a short double-“o,” as in “look” or “book”—and what it implied for the movie, which as it turned out, is, in my opinion, the finest and most genuinely provocative horror movie to emerge in this still very-new century. Both a relentless psychological thriller with heavy primal stuff on its mind and a full-throttle slam-bang scare-fest, it delivers raw sensation without insulting the intelligence the way the more sensationalist but also essentially trite pictures in the New Horror Paradigm along the lines of “Insidious” tend to do.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is it legal to own moon dust?</h2><time>May 5, 2024</time>
