The texture of canned corn varies wildly. The best stuff, in the opinion of Sporked, is soft yet crisp. Most canned sweet corn is overcooked, mushy, and textureless. Those didn’t make the list. We want canned corn to feel fresh, and there’s no reason it shouldn’t—canned corn does a pretty good job at <a href=# rel=noopener>retaining nutrients</a> throughout the canning process.</p><p>For this update of the best canned corn ranking, we also included the best cream of corn in a can (aka canned cream corn or canned creamed corn, depending on who you’re talking to). For that, we were looking for something creamy (duh, it’s in the name) but not mushy and definitely not watery. We want cream corn from a can to taste like a side you’d get at a great Southern diner—it should be seasoned and a little decadent but still include pops of sweet corn kernels. We also added the best no salt added can of corn. For that, we were looking for natural, pure, sweet corn flavor. Just because there’s no salt doesn’t mean it has to be flavorless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;So what’s the best canned corn? We tasted nearly 30 to bring you the top nine.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Del Monte Whole Kernel Corn No Salt Added" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-CORN_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Low Sodium</strong></p><strong>Del Monte Whole Kernel Corn No Salt Added</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>After tasting nearly 30 cans of corn, we weren’t surprised that such a good can of corn came from Del Monte—you’ll be seeing that brand pop up a lot in this ranking. This has a ton of flavor for a no salt added product. It’s not quite as vibrant as the other canned corn on this list, but the kernels are firm, crisp, and vibrant yellow. It tastes kind of like end-of-summer corn—just slightly past its sweet peak but still quite good, especially if you’re living that low sodium life. — Justine Sterling</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_CANNED-CORN_INSET_REDUCTION-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sweet</p><strong>Libby’s Whole Kernel Sweet Corn</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This was the sweetest canned corn we tried in our taste test—and there’s no added sugar according to the label.

Libby’s canned corn is sweet but not saccharine, making it the best canned corn option if you’re looking for something on the sugary side for homemade cornbread—or enhancing <a href=#>boxed cornbread mix</a>. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=514 height=585 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_CANNED-CORN_INSET_REDUCTION-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Smoky</p><strong>Del Monte Whole Kernel Fire Roasted Corn Blend</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This Del Monte corn has the classic taste of the brand’s Golden Sweet corn (spoiler alert, it’s our #1 pick) but with an added bit of fire-roasted flavor. It’s quite nice, and the built-in smokiness makes it a great can of corn for salsas and salads. Del Monte has more salt than its competitors, but I think that works in its favor. The sweetness and the salinity balance each other out and make for some seriously delicious and savory corn in a can. — Danny Palumbo&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_CANNED-CORN_INSET_REDUCTION-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Creamed Corn</p><strong>Happy Harvest Whole Kernel Sweet Corn</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Aldi brand Happy Harvest touts that its corn was “picked and packed” on the same day. These kernels have a delightful crunch. It’s an excellent antidote to the textureless and mushy corn other brands are canning. It’s also very sweet—six grams of sugar in just half a cup—and the kernels are big, to which I say hell yeah.&nbsp; Big kernels of corn seem to have a crisper bite to them. These big hunks of sweet corn would be great for any stew, soup, salad, or creamed corn situation. It’s all-purpose canned corn that you’ll regularly use at home. — Danny Palumbo</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc/Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Glory Foods Seasoned Southern Style Cream Style Skillet Corn" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-CORN_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Canned Cream Corn</p><strong>Glory Foods Seasoned Southern Style Cream Style Skillet Corn</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Glory Foods makes the best canned creamed corn we tasted. It’s quite salty and savory—but you’re eating cream corn from a can, are you really trying to skimp on the sodium? You even get some charred flavor as if this canned cream corn really was cooked in a skillet! But the real deciding factor for me is the cream itself. Many of the other canned cream corn brands we tried were super watery. Not Glory. This canned creamed corn is made with a ton of corn kernels and just enough creamy broth to cross the line into creamed corn territory.

The kernels are smaller (I tend to prefer big hunks of corn), but the flavor is quite savory and buttery. Although there is 130mg of sodium per serving compared to Del Monte’s 320mg, it still tastes quite salty to me.

Trader Joe’s canned corn is just sweet enough, not noticeably salty (there’s just enough salt to highlight the sweetness), and it is cheap because it’s TJ’s. There’s no added sugar and no preservatives. And it comes in a super-pleasing retro-style can that looks like it would be at home in a 1950s fallout shelter. It’s the best canned corn to stock up on for the apocalypse or just everyday cooking—or eating straight out of the can for lunch. — Justine Sterling</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Trader Joe’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Del Monte Summer Crisp Golden Sweet Corn" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RANKING-UPDATE_CANNED-CORN_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Runner-Up</p><strong>Del Monte Summer Crisp Golden Sweet Corn</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>What’s the difference between this Del Monte Sweet Corn and our number one Del Monte Sweet Corn?

In terms of flavor, it’s an excellent can of corn. It’s crisp and crunchy and bright and perfectly seasoned—no extra salt needed.

The kernels are surprisingly crispy—this isn’t mushy, textureless, cooked-to-oblivion corn. It’s al dente, in a way. And the flavor is just excellent. Buttery, salty, and sweet, Del Monte canned corn is a real treat. I was delighted to eat this straight out of the can, but, obviously, there are many ways you could deploy this corn in your at-home cooking.
