Satormura has wrestled in <a href=#>WCW</a> and in <a href=#>Chikara</a> along with several Japanese-based promotions throughout the course of her 23-year career. <a href=#>WWE wrote the following of Satomura</a>:</p><p>A head-kicking demigod of the Japanese wrestling scene is headed to the&nbsp;<a class=wwe-wysiwyg--link href=#>Mae Young Classic</a>.</p><p>Meiko Satomura, a 23-year veteran who is considered the final boss in Japan — the one opponent that every starry-eyed wrestler strives to defeat — is now confirmed for this year’s global tournament, Tokyo Sports reported.</p><p>A living legend in the Far East, Satomura began training for the ring in 1994 at age 14. She made her professional debut the following year and stands as one of the few active competitors whose origin dates to Japan’s thunderous women’s wrestling boom in the 1990s. Viewed as a top prospect from day one, Satomura even competed in WCW early in her career. Mentored by Chigusa Nagayo (one-half of the famous Crush Girls tag team), she also trained under catch-wrestling icon Billy Robinson.</p><p>Known for her debilitating Death Valley Bomb and explosive Scorpion Rising axe kick, Satomura is a master of&nbsp;Joshi&nbsp;Strong Style (the hard-hitting in-ring style associated with Japanese female wrestlers). As the founder of Sendai Girls Pro Wrestling, she has been a formidable advocate for women’s wrestling.</p><p>With such vast experience, Satomura may just be the most daunting competitor to be named to the Mae Young Classic yet. Stay tuned to WWE.com in the coming days and weeks for more details on this summer’s hotly anticipated tournament.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhZdpa2prXZ%2Busa3NnqqeZZyatKa6w2aYp6afqrukscNmnaiqXaKupnnYqKynn12YuaK%2F0qKaZmpgZoU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-joel-osteen-the-richest-pastor-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>Is Joel Osteen the richest pastor in the world?</span></a>
