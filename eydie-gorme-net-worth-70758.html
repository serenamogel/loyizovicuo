Playing to SRO audiences around the world and winning rave reviews, the one-year tour culminated in New York's Madison Square Garden. Frank Sinatra says, "Steve and Eydie represent all that is good about performers and the interpretation of a song..they're the best.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1928</span><p>Gorm√© was born on August 16, 1928 as Edith Garmezano in the Manhattan borough of New York City to Nessim and Fortuna, Sephardic Jewish immigrants. Her father, a tailor, was from Sicily and her mother was from <a href=#>Turkey</a>. Gorm√© was a cousin of singer-songwriter Neil Sedaka.</p><span>1946</span><p>She graduated from <a href=#>william</a> Howard Taft High School in 1946 with Stanley Kubrick in her class. She worked for the United Nations as an interpreter, using her fluency in the Ladino and <a href=#>Spanish</a> languages, while singing in Ken Greengrass's band during the weekends.</p><span>1950</span><p>She got her big break and her recording debut in 1950 with the Tommy Tucker Orchestra and Don Brown. She made a second recording which featured Dick Noel. MGM issued these two recordings on 78.</p><span>1951</span><p>Gorm√© worked in Tex Beneke's band. In 1951 she made several radio recordings that have been reissued on vinyl LP and recently on CD. In 1952 Gorm√© went on to record solo, and her first recordings were issued on the Coral label. During this time, she was featured on the radio program "Cita Con Eydie" ("An Appointment with Eydie"). She changed her name from Edith to Edie but later changed it to Eydie because people constantly mispronounced Edie as Eddie. Gorme also considered changing her family name; however, her mother protested, "It's bad enough that you're in show <a href=#>Business</a>. How will the neighbors know if you're ever a success?"</p><span>1953</span><p>In 1953, Gorm√© made her first television appearance, and met her <a href=#>Future</a> husband, singer <a href=#>Steve Lawrence</a>, when they were booked for the original <i>The Tonight Show</i>, hosted by Steve Allen.</p><span>1957</span><p>Gorm√© and Lawrence were married in Las Vegas on December 29, 1957. They became famous on stage for their banter, which usually involved tart yet affectionate, and sometimes bawdy, references to their married life, which remained a feature of their live act.</p><span>1958</span><p>In 1958, they starred together in <i>The <a href=#>Steve Lawrence</a>-Eydie Gorme Show</i>, a summer replacement for <i>The Steve Allen Show</i>. During the 1970s, the two made guest appearances on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i>, either with Eydie appearing as the guest and going into her song and Steve suddenly coming out from backstage and joining her or the other way around.</p><span>1960</span><p>Gorm√© and Lawrence had two sons together. David Nessim Lawrence (b.&nbsp;1960) is an ASCAP Award-winning <a href=#>Composer</a> who composed the score for <i>High School Musical</i>. Michael Robert Lawrence (1962-1986) died suddenly at the age of 23 from ventricular fibrillation resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition. Michael was an assistant <a href=#>Editor</a> for a television show and was apparently healthy despite a previous diagnosis of slight arrhythmia.</p><span>1963</span><p>Eydie Gorm√© enjoyed hit singles of her own, none selling bigger than 1963's "Blame It on the Bossa Nova", which was also her final foray into the Top 40 pop charts. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. In the UK, "Yes, My Darling Daughter" reached #10. She won a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Performance in 1967, for her version of "If He Walked Into My Life", from <i>Mame</i>. The latter made #5 on the Billboard magazine Easy Listening chart in 1966, despite failing to make the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Many of Gorm√©'s singles chart success from 1963 onward were on the Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary charts, where she placed 27 singles (both solo and with her husband) from 1963 to 1979 (of which "If He Walked Into My Life" was the most successful). As a soloist, her other biggest hits during that period included "What Did I Have That I Don't Have?" from <i>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</i> (#17 Easy Listening, 1966) and "Tonight I'll Say a Prayer" (#45 Pop and #8 Easy Listening, 1969, also her last Hot 100 entry as a solo artist).</p><span>1964</span><p>In 1964, the label released the album, <i>Amor</i>, which spent 22 weeks on the charts. One of the songs, <i>Sabor a M√≠,</i> became closely identified with Gorm√© and emerged as one of her signature tunes. An early video of her rendition of this classic exists here. The disc was later reissued 18 times, with various names including as <i>Eydie Gorm√© Canta en Espa√±ol con el Trio Los Panchos;</i> it remains the top-performing album in her oeuvre on iTunes. In 1965, a sequel appeared called <i>More Amor</i> (later reissued as <i>Cuatro Vidas</i>). Her last album with Los Panchos was a 1966 Christmas collection, <i>Navidad Means Christmas</i>, later reissued as <i>Blanca Navidad</i>. Gorm√© also recorded other <a href=#>Spanish</a> albums in her career, including the Grammy-nominated <i>La Gorm√©</i> (1976), a contemporary outing. The 1977 release <i>Muy Amigos/Close Friends,</i> a duet collection with Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera, also received a Grammy nomination.</p><span>1970</span><p>Gorm√© and Lawrence appeared numerous times on TV, including 13 appearances on <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i>, as well as <i>The Nanny</i>. She and Lawrence starred together on Broadway in the musical <i>Golden Rainbow</i>. After the 1970s, the couple focused strictly on the <a href=#>American</a> pop repertoire, recording several albums themed around individual <a href=#>American</a> pop composers. Also, she did a duo with one of the most popular <a href=#>Mexican</a> boleros in the 1950s Los Panchos. They released the song "Sabor a m√≠."</p><span>1995</span><p>She was also awarded the Society of <a href=#>Singers</a> Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.</p><span>2002</span><p>As the 21st century arrived, the couple announced their plans to cut back on their touring, launching a "One More For The Road" tour in 2002. In 2006, Gorm√© became a <a href=#>Blogger</a>, posting occasional messages on her official website. In November 2009, after his wife retired, Lawrence embarked on a solo musical tour.</p><span>2013</span><p>Gorm√© died on August 10, 2013, six days before her 85th birthday, at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center in Las Vegas following a brief, undisclosed illness. Her husband, <a href=#>Steve Lawrence</a>, was at her bedside, along with their surviving son, David. She is also survived by her granddaughter. She was interred at Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a>.</p><span>2019</span><p>Eydie gained crossover success in the Latin music market and internationally through a series of albums she made in <a href=#>Spanish</a> with the famed Trio Los Panchos. Eydie‚Äôs first recording with Los Panchos came about after the popular group from <a href=#>Mexico</a>, then composed of Alfredo Gil, Chucho Navarro and Johnny Albino, saw her perform at Manhattan‚Äôs Club Copacabana late in 1963. The chanteuse had just achieved international fame with <i>Blame it on Bossa Nova,</i> which sold 250,000 copies in <a href=#>Spanish</a> in addition to the <a href=#>English</a> sales. Los Panchos were the top bolero <a href=#>Singers</a> in Latin America at the time, so when the <a href=#>Mexican</a> stars suggested a recording, Columbia supported the idea and soon the 12 songs were selected and recorded.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1928 births</a> <a href=#>2013 deaths</a> <a href=#>ABC Records artists</a> <a href=#>MGM Records artists</a> <a href=#>Columbia Records artists</a> <a href=#>American female singers</a> <a href=#>American people of Italian-Jewish descent</a> <a href=#>American people of Sicilian descent</a> <a href=#>American people of Turkish-Jewish descent</a> <a href=#>American pop singers</a> <a href=#>American Sephardic Jews</a> <a href=#>Sephardi Jews</a> <a href=#>Burials at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery</a> <a href=#>Disease-related deaths in Nevada</a> <a href=#>Grammy Award winners</a> <a href=#>Jewish American musicians</a> <a href=#>Jewish singers</a> <a href=#>People from the Bronx</a> <a href=#>Primetime Emmy Award winners</a> <a href=#>Singers from New York City</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeVrrGqsYygpqullWK7psCMsKarrJhihHGDlHE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carole-mallory.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Carole Mallory- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</span></a>
