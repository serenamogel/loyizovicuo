Adam rose to fame as a co-host of the television science entertainment series “Myth Busters” (2003–present) and science and engineering reality game show “Unchained Reaction” (2012). His created scale models might be seen in the blockbusters “Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones” (2002) directed by <a href=#>George Lucas</a> and “The Matrix Reloaded” (2003) directed by The Wachowski Brothers.</p><p>How much is Adam Savage net worth? Report by authoritative sources, his wealth stands at and estimated $12 million accumulated in large part from his contribution to special effects in film making, but beginning in the wider entertainment industry which began seriously in the ’80s.</p><h3>Adam Savage Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Adam grew up in Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County, New York. His father was a famous animator and film-maker, who worked on the television series “Sesame Street” (1969–2000), so Adam had an early introduction to the industry, and in fact became a child actor when just five years old, voicing characters featured in “Sesame Street” (1969 – 2000), and appearing in various commercials, music videos and other small roles. As an adult, he decided to continue his work just on the other side of the stage, as he got more enjoyment from making things, in particular he became really good at creating special effects, making graphic designs and assisting in animation, and these added significant amounts to the overall size of Adam Savage’s net worth.</p><p>In fact, Adam Savage has many accomplishments which are even difficult to count, including film developer, projectionist, carpenter, graphic designer, animator, television presenter, toy designer, gallery owner, model maker, actor and television presenter. He was a model maker for the science fiction films “Galaxy Quest” (1999), “Bicentennial Man” (1999) and “Space Cowboys” (2000), and also worked as an educator for model making at the Academy of Art University. More, he appeared as an actor in the films “Ever Since the World Ended” (2001), “The Darwin Awards” (2006) and in an episode of television series “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” (2008). Of course all these projects added to Adam’s net worth.</p><p>Adam Savage has been covering different topics as the annual speaker at the Maker Faire since 2008. However, to the wider audience he is mostly known as the co-presenter of the documentary science series “Myth Busters” (2003–present) created by Peter Rees, which focuses on testing the validity of various myths and rumours using scientific methods. The two basic heroes of the show are co-hosts Adam Savage and <a href=#>Jamie Hyneman</a>, and indeed “Myth Busters” is the highest rated series on the Discovery channel, and the series might be seen through many international broadcasters too. All the previously described careers have added financially to the total size of Adam Savage’s net worth.</p><p>As a little aside from his professional work, he is an avid costume maker and has an interest in cosplay. He has created one costume for&nbsp; the character from the Japanese animated film “Spirited Away” (2001).</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Adam Savage, he has been married since 2002 to Julia Ward;&nbsp; he has twin boys from a previous relationship. Adam Savage resides in San Francisco.&nbsp;Nowadays he states that he is an atheist.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.404226618705><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Adam Savage</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 15, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 11 in (1.82 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Educator, Television producer, Special Effects Designer, Presenter, Industrial designer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>New York University, Tisch School of the Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Julia Savage (m. 2002)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Riley Savage, Addison Savage</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Whitney Lee Savage</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Kate Savage</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Adam Whitney Savage , The Mythbusters , Adam John Savage , Aaahh!
