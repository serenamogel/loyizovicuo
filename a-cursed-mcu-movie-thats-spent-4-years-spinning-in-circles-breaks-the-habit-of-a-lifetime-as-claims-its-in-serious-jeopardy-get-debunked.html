So when rumors circulated that it might be in “serious jeopardy” and be on the edge of simply being canceled, it didn’t seem all that far-fetched.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blade-1.jpg><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>And yet, believe it or not, it looks like Blade is actually receiving some good news for once as further intel indicates we don’t have anything to fear. In response to claims that both Thunderbolts and Blade would be ditched by Marvel following the conclusion of the strikes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insider Daniel Richtman</a> dismissed the talk as nonsense, debunking the rumor as “not true.”</p><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=false>After various creative overhauls, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the last we heard</a> Blade was all set to be directed by Lovecraft Country‘s Yann Demange and written by Michael Starrbury. Filming was due to kick off this spring, but naturally, that didn’t happen thanks to the strikes. At present, it’s still attached to its Sep. 6, 2024 release date, although if it made that it would be a miracle. Nonetheless, apparently, Blade will rise up out of its grave eventually, so we don’t need to be concerned it’s going to get staked before it can walk. Or ice-skate uphill, as the case may be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGabpafAprCMppquZZ2kw6qxjK2fmqyjYsCxsc2tZG1lqZqus7%2BMrKeipp6eu6h5yKdknKGimLmmv4ybqZ6Zm6h6tbTEZp%2BampmperCyjJpkpaGWmsGqucRmmKxlk6GuqrnSZqCtq12eu26%2FxKugqK2jYremu8%2BaqZ2xXZyytXnDnpmuppuasXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steven-crowder-net-worth-2021-wife-height-dog-criticisms.html><span>←</span><span>Steven Crowder Net Worth (2021): Wife, Height, Dog, &amp;amp; Criticisms</span></a>
