A Los Angeles coroner told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/movies/21murphy.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Associated Press" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Associated Press</a> that the cause of death “appears to be natural.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“A bright light that lit the world is forever dimmed, but will live on in the hearts of those that Brittany touched,” her family said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/arts/26arts-FUNERALISHEL_BRF.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=statement class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">statement</a>. “Brittany was an incredibly loving and passionate person and an artist to her core.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even with the facts out there, something seemed off. On February 4, 2010, an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/movies/05arts-PNEUMONIACIT_BRF.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="updated coroner’s report" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">updated coroner’s report</a> was released, citing anemia and prescription drugs played a role in her death that ultimately was caused by “community acquired pneumonia.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And as it turns out, the mystery was just beginning.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Murphy's husband and mother first got sick in Puerto Rico</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 2009, Murphy traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to film a movie The Caller, and her husband, Simon Monjack, and mother, Sharon Murphy, went with her, according to a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hollywood Reporter</a> story by family friend Alex Ben Block.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Immediately things went wrong. Murphy was fired the first day, with some reports pointing fingers to Monjack’s on-set drunken behavior. But they stayed on the island to vacation and Monjack and Sharon both caught Staphylococcus. On the flight back to Los Angeles, Murphy gave her husband CPR after he says he had a “mild heart attack.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Eventually, Murphy also caught Staphylococcus aureus — and it hit her hard. By mid-December, she had a terrible bout of laryngitis and was going through her second period in a month that caused anemia. For six weeks, she thought she could overcome it and didn’t seek medical attention, but finally called on Friday to make an appointment for Monday. But she never made it through that weekend.</p><img alt="Brittany Murphy poses for portraits at Tt Collection Pop-Up Party on December 3, 2009, in Los Angeles, California, just two weeks before her death" title="Brittany Murphy poses for portraits at Tt Collection Pop-Up Party on December 3, 2009, in Los Angeles, California, just two weeks before her death" width=2138 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-94981055.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Brittany Murphy poses for portraits at Tt Collection Pop-Up Party in Los Angeles, California&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>on December 3, 2009,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>just two weeks before her death; Photo: Michael Bezjian/WireImage</span></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Murphy served as a caretaker for her mother and husband</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even though she was dealing with her own ailments, Murphy had been taken care of both her mother, who struggled with neuropathy after surviving breast cancer and her husband, who dealt with seizures and sleep apnea.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trapped in her $3.9 million home on Rising Glen Road she bought in 2003 from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/britney-spears data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Britney Spears" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Britney Spears</a>, but <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="now hated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">now hated</a>, the only comfort zone she could escape to was her bathroom. Yet even there, her thoughts were anything but calm. “She spent hours sampling the cosmetics and perfumes that crowded every inch of counter space, critically studying her body image,” Block wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There was only one thought that kept her going: a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="new start in New York City" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">new start in New York City</a>.

The day she died, she had also taken an anti-depression drug (fluoxetine, aka Prozac), an anti-seizure drug (Klonopin), an anti-inflammatory (methylprednisolone) and a beta blocker that Simon gave her, as well as Vicoprofen to ease pain from her period.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after, she fell in the bathroom and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brittany-murphys-dad-tells-gma-657420 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told her mom" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told her mom</a>, “I’m dying.

He cited how she had been dropped from Happy Feet 2 and stories and frustration with unfounded stories about Murphy’s drug use.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Only later would I realize that much of what Simon told me — about his family, education, marriage and career — was exaggerated or simply fabricated,” Block said.</p><img alt="Simon Monjack and Sharon Murphy during a photoshoot on January 13, 2010 in Hollywood, California" title="Simon Monjack and Sharon Murphy during a photoshoot on January 13, 2010 in Hollywood, California" width=3000 height=2172 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-97753120.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Simon Monjack and Sharon Murphy during a photo shoot in Hollywood, California&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>on January 13, 2010, less than a month after Brittany Murphy's death&lt;/em>; Photo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Her husband died under similar circumstances five months later</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the world continued searching for explanations for Murphy’s passing, another shocking occurrence was revealed: Monjack died on May 23, 2010, at the age of 39, in the same bedroom as Murphy, also from acute pneumonia and anemia, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The odd coincidence of the cause and place raised more suspicions, but Sharon was quick to quiet them. “It is with great relief that Simon's preliminary autopsy findings have been released, so the media speculations can stop,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/07/21/simon.monjack.autopsy/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she said</a>. “As I was sure of, just like my daughter Brittany, there was no kind of drug overdose.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn’t the first time Sharon felt the need to keep the story straight. When Block’s piece was published in January 2011, she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Tonight" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Tonight</a> the quotes were “100-percent untrue.”</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Murphy’s parents fought over theories about their daughter's death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Questions continued to come up over the years and in November 2013, Murphy’s dad, Angelo Bertolotti, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brittany-murphys-dad-tells-gma-657420 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Good Morning America" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Good Morning America</a> his take: “I have a feeling that there was definitely a murder situation here… Yeah, it's poison. Yes, yes, I know that.” He had ordered additional toxicology reports and claimed that his daughter’s hair showed there were 10 heavy metals in her system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Murphy’s father hadn’t been in her life much, as she shared a tight-knit relationship with her mother. “They were adorable together,” Murphy’s former agent and manager JoAnne Colonna told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “They finished each other’s sentences. Both were bright and bubbly, and that relationship never changed.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sharon quickly denied Bertolotti's claims in an open letter to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brittany-murphys-mother-breaks-silence-659529 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Hollywood Reporter</a>: “His claims are based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an insight into what really happened.” She went on to describe how a hair sample is unreliable.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She ended the letter defiantly: “She was my baby, and we stood together throughout Brittany's life. Now I must stand up for her again. It is time for those who really knew and loved her to put those who want to exploit her on notice: Your lies will no longer be tolerated, and as long as I live will continue to be exposed.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bertolotti died in 2019 at the age of 92.
