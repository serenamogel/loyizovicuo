An injured rafter is one that extends from the hip to the valley of a roof or is cut short to accommodate an aperture such as a chimney or skylight, among other things. Neither cripple studs nor cripple rafters are built of a different stock than normal studs or rafters; they are simply cut to a shorter length.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sean ODonnell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>Jan 31, 2024</time>
