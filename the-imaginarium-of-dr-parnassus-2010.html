<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus movie review (2010)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It involves a bizarre, threadbare traveling show that unfolds out of a rickety old wagon in rundown pockets of London occupied mostly by drunks and grotesques. The show consists of the (very, very) old Parnassus (<a href=#>Christopher Plummer</a>) perching ominously on a stool while his barker, Anton (<a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a>); his daughter, Valentina (<a href=#>Lily Cole</a>), and his angry dwarf, Percy (<a href=#>Verne Troyer</a>), perform for an unruly handful of lager louts.</p><p>Percy and Anton save the life of a man hanging from a bridge. Why only they can perform this task is wisely not explained. The man on the rope is Tony (Heath Ledger). I know. He joins the show, is appalled by its archaic form and suggests updates. The reason it's creaky is that Parnassus is many centuries old, having made a pact with Satan (<a href=#>Tom Waits</a>, as usual) to live forever on condition that Satan can possess Valentina (Lily Cole) when she turns 16. You have to admit Parnassus didn't rush into reproduction. Of course he wants out of the deal. Satan frequently runs into credit payment risks.</p><p>Tony, it develops, can enter/evoke/control/create strange worlds on the other side of a lookingglass on the shabby stage. In these worlds, anything goes, which is always to Gilliam's liking. CGI allows the director and his designers to run riot, which they do at a gallop, and some wondrous visions materialize.</p><p>I believe Ledger was intended to be the guide through all of these realms. But Gilliam apparently completed filming all the outer-world London scenes, Ledger returned to New York for R&R, and the rest is sad history. Gilliam replaced him by casting <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, <a href=#>Jude Law</a> and <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a> as the Tonys of Imaginariums Nos. 1 through 3 and offering no other explanation, as indeed with Imaginariums, he isn't required to do. Depp looks the most like Ledger, but it's a melancholy fact that Farrell steals the role.</p><p>My problem with Gilliam's films is that they lack a discernible storyline. I don't require A-B-C, Act 1-2-3, but I do rather appreciate having some notion of a film's own rules. Gilliam indeed practices "Something Wonderful Right Away," and you get the notion that if an idea pops into his head, he feels free to write it into his script under the <a href=#>Cole Porter</a> Rule ("Anything Goes"). Knowing my history with Gilliam, who I always want to like more than I do, I attended the Cannes screening of "Doctor Parnassus" to be baffled, which I was, and then the Chicago press screening, where I had an idea what was coming and tried to reopen my mind. Gilliam is, you understand, a nice man, and has never committed the sin of failing to amaze.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmaKuqLXNmqmirZ1ivKd5w6tkqZmio660v9SsZGtoYWU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nat-king-cole-net-worth-172445.html><span>←</span><span>Nat King Cole Net Worth</span></a>
