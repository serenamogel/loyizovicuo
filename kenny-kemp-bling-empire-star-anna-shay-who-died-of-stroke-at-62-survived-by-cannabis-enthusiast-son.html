Following the unexpected demise, her family said in a statement, "It saddens our hearts to announce that Anna Shay, a loving mother, grandmother, charismatic star, and our brightest ray of sunshine, has passed away at the early age of 62 from a stroke."</p><p>"Anna taught us many life lessons on how not to take life too seriously and to enjoy the finer things. Her impact on our lives will be forever missed but never forgotten," read the statement, reported People. Shay became a fan favorite of the Netflix series following her appearance on the show in its inaugural season in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/ca81e659-1486-447b-929b-8cb11506c284.1396982659><h2 class=split>Who is Kenny Kemp?</h2><p>Shay's only son Kenny Kemp is described as a cannabis enthusiast who has a "collection of bongs worth half a million dollars." The 29-year-old who is known as a "passionate stoner" loves the craft and owns five-figured Nintendo-inspired creature-shaped bongs, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>. He has made a brief appearance on 'Bling Empire' alongside his mother. Kemp is Shay's son from one of her four previous marriages.</p><h2 class=split>Shay's co-stars paid their respects</h2><p>Talking about his regret of not being able to have "one last adventure" with Shay, her co-star Kevin Kreider said, “My last memory was having lunch and she said, ‘Let's go on an adventure.'"</p><p>"My regret is that I didn't step into her car and go with her with my girlfriend and Maria. It's a lesson to smell the roses and take a moment. That day, I was so bombarded by work and pressures that I didn't get to have that last adventure with her," he continued.</p><p>"I took it for granted and believed I'd have plenty more of these and would save it for another day,” he continues. “The adventures could be just having coffee, but knowing Anna, it's never just coffee. It's shopping, lunches and dinners, and even last-minute traveling," Kreider added, according to People.</p><p>The reality star paid his tribute to Shay as he took to Instagram to share a video featuring him and the late costar that showed pictures and clips of them spending time together. "You never know when your last goodbye will be. So unexpected and wished when I saw you last for lunch I would have taken a moment to smell the roses and had one last adventure with you," Kreider captioned the Instagram post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoo5Wju7p5yp6kqWWSobavs4yepKmhopp6tMDAq2Sapp6WerS0wLJksKCfYrGqscNmpp9lo6m%2FsLfEZpitZWZnerTB0a%2Bgr52UYq%2B6ecKapaeZkp7AbrHNrZ%2Buq5mWwLV50qil</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-deadwyler.html><span>←</span><span>Danielle Deadwyler</span></a>
