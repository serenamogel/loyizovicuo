<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Who is Byron Yawns wife? Robin Yawn found burner phone pastor used in Julianna Zobrist affair</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>American Baseball player Ben Zobrist, who retired from a 14-season <a href=# rel>Major League Baseball</a> career in March 2020, has filed a $6 million lawsuit against Byron Yawn, the CEO of Forrest Crain & Co., a Nashville-area business-consulting firm. Yawn is a former pastor and an elder at Community Bible Church in Nashville. The reason why Ben is suing Yawn is because the latter allegedly had an affair with the former Chicago Cubs star’s wife Julianna Zobrist.</p><p>As per reports, the athlete filed a lawsuit in May 2021 through a Tennessee circuit court. He and Julianna got married in 2005 and have three children. The couple reportedly met Yawn more than 16 years ago at the Community Bible Church. The suit claims that Yawn served as their <a href=# rel>pastor</a>, and was also accepted into their lives as a “spiritual mentor,” who provided pre-marital <a href=# rel>counseling</a> for the couple in 2005.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julianna Zobrist and Byron Yawn's affair: How Ben Zobrist knew about wife and pastor's relationship</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump slammed for 'Boycott MLB' call after All-Star Game moved out of Georgia over voting law: 'Stop crying'</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b438fb2e-c7ce-4bbf-a96c-e2263c46ce1e.620756546><p>In his lawsuit, Ben has claimed that Yawn, “while acting in his capacity as pastoral counselor to” the Zobrists, “usurped this ministerial-counselor role, violated and betrayed the confidence entrusted to him by the Plaintiff, breached his fiduciary duty” owed to Ben, and “deceitfully used his access as counselor to engage in an<a href=# rel> inappropriate sexual relationship</a>” with Julianna.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who are Byron Yawn’s wife and children?</h2><p>According to a short bio on the website for the Hope Church in Madison, Alabama, where Yawn served as a guest speaker, Yawn and his wife Robin grew up down the street from each other. “They were high school sweethearts and had the special blessing of coming to faith during the same period of their lives,” the bio noted. “Their marriage has been about the Gospel from the very beginning.”&nbsp;</p><p>The couple has three children -- Lauren, Wade and Blake. Yawn and his wife arrived at Community Bible Church in early 2001, the bio noted, adding that during their years there, “they have seen the church flourish under a continuing commitment to expository preaching.”</p><p>Julianna and Yawn allegedly used “burner phones” to help hide the relationship. The lawsuit claimed that in May 2019, Yawn’s wife Robin “discovered that he had a burner phone. Mrs. Yawn told her husband that” if Julianna did not tell Ben about this, “she would do so,” adding that Robin “did confide to Mr. Zobrist the following day that she believed her husband and his wife were having an emotional relationship, but nothing physical.”&nbsp;</p><p>Following this, the Zobrists began marital counseling with the goal of “re-strengthening their marriage.” Byron Yawn and Robin Yawn also allegedly engaged in marital counseling sometime in 2019 following the discovery of the burner phone, the lawsuit said.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben, who was scheduled to return playing professional baseball in the summer of 2019, was unable to do so due to “the newly discovered information from Robin Yawn, and his need to turn his focus entirely on repairing his marital relationship,” the lawsuit alleged. As a consequence, Ben allegedly forfeited four months of his 2019 season of his professional baseball contract resulting in approximately eight million dollars of lost income.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJuwq6eeYsaiw81mrqKelWK%2FsK7Ip2Sfp6WjsW6u1KulnqpdpbWwusRmp5qrpKS%2FbsHSnptmoZ5it7a4yJqlp5ldr7yjvsisq2aZlpuuqr6Mm5ynZZyWxLTByA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mustafa-goelbasi.html><span>←</span><span>Mustafa Goelbasi- Net worth, Bio, Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Ethnicity</span></a>
