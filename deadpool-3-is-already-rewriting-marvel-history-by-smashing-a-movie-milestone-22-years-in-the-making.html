A big part of that is the fact that Deadpool, one of the most definitive cinematic superheroes of the past decade, has not been seen on the big screen for a full six years. If that feels like a hideously long time to wait for a much-anticipated Marvel sequel then, well, there’s a very good reason for that.</p><h2 id=h-deadpool-wolverine-taking-six-years-to-reach-cinemas-makes-it-a-marvel-record-holder data-injectable=false>Deadpool & Wolverine taking six years to reach cinemas makes it a Marvel record-holder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deadpool-3_b14082.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deadpool-Wolverine.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deadpool-Wolverine-2-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deadpool-Wolverine-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/deadpool-tva-elevator-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DW-Trailer-1-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deadpool-1.jpg><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>The gap of half a dozen years between 2018’s Deadpool 2 and 2024’s Deadpool 3 is actually the longest it’s ever taken for a Marvel sequel to hit theaters. We may have had reboots and remakes be added to a franchise in periods longer than this but never has a direct follow-up, in the way that & Wolverine is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very much a spiritual successor to DP2</a>, taken so such a stretch of time to release.</p><p data-characters=769 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>The very first Marvel sequel movie came our way 22 years ago in the form of 2002’s Blade II, with the second being 2003’s X2, which of course also starred Hugh Jackman. Since then, it’s become the norm for these things to release three or perhaps four years after the last one. In recent times, the interconnectedness of the MCU has forced us to widen the definition of a sequel a little, but the record still stands. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 came six years after Vol. 2, to be fair, but that film was very much a sequel to 2019’s Avengers: Endgame so it’s a different kettle of fish — we only had to go four years without seeing the Guardians. Truly, no other Marvel sequel has taken its sweet time like Deadpool & Wolverine.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=false>Of course, there is a very valid and unusual reason for DP3‘s tardiness; Disney’s Fox takeover happening a year after DP2 dropped meant that Marvel had to take some time to figure out how Deadpool could fit into both its storytelling plans and its release schedule. Finally, after all that hassle, the wait is almost over. If the gap between this one and Deadpool 4 is as long, though, then Jackman’s Logan is not the only one who’s going to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">break out into a berserker rage</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom56ZlKW8sLiMbGSiq12WubOxwJ2wZqqVrL%2BqwMinnmalkafDpriMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm6u2Gaqppmjnbavs4yaZKanpp6ybrnIpZysrJ%2Bjsm5%2BkWawnpmiqHqquoytn55lnZa4qrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kardashians-have-worked-hard-to-stay-in-touch-with-their-armenian-roots.html><span>←</span><span> Kardashians have worked hard to stay in touch with their Armenian roots Wed 8 June 2022 20:15</span></a>
