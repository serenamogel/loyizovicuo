Mark was looking for less of a wife and more of a mother for his kids (some older than Nikki). A point he drove home throughout Season 3 by <a href=#>continuously mentioning</a> that he never imagined fatherhood as being alone with his kids. While it's unclear what exactly Mark thought raising children entailed, it is clear that he was determined to find a new wife to share the burden. The Father of the Year Award goes to Mark... just kidding.</p><p>Nikki didn't seem to mind the stepmom role and happily accepted Mark's marriage proposal and a one-way ticket to the Mid-Atlantic. But Mark had some rules before he'd make it official. First, <a href=#>he made Nikki sign a prenup</a> that ensured she'd get nothing if they were to divorce. Second, <a href=#>Mark made it clear that he had zero interest</a> in having any more kids. Starting a family is a big decision, and he generously gave Nikki 24 hours to decide if she'd ever like to be a mother. Nikki agreed to his demands, but was heartbroken over the decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark wasn't all bad, though! He balanced out all his seemingly controlling rules by buying Nikki <a href=#>the exact same car he bought his ex-wife.</a> Oh, wait, that's also&nbsp;not great.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xgaX16e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zJqppGWRo7FuusikoqJllqe8rnmYaWSdmalis6qtzZycaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meg-cabot-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Meg Cabot Net Worth: Novels, Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
