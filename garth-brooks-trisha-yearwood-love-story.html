"We had a lot more in common than I ever dreamed we did,” Brooks told DeGeneres.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though they had known each other through the music industry, Brooks says he and Yearwood finally got to see each other “as people. And I gotta tell you, if you like her and don’t know her you’ll love her, and if you love her and don’t know her you’re gonna worship her. She’s the real deal and I’m very lucky.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The “Lost in You” singer and Yearwood allowed their romantic relationship to blossom away from the public spotlight before making their first public appearance as a couple in 2002. Brooks proposed to Yearwood on May 25, 2005, during the unveiling of 10 bronze statues of country music artists – one of which was Brooks – at Buck Owen’s Crystal Palace in Bakersfield, California. Brooks had sculptor Bill Rains include a wedding ring on his likeness and in front of 7,000 people he removed his hat, dropped to one knee and proposed.

Brooks was still retired when they wed and Yearwood cut her tour dates “way down” in order to be by her husband’s side, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/492802/jerylbrunner/garth-brooks-on-trisha-yearwood-i-love-breathing-the-same-air-shes-breathing/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Parade" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to Parade</a>. The “Georgia Rain” singer even quit touring and focused on her cookbooks and cooking show Trisha’s Southern Kitchen in order to do “something creatively” at home and not be away from her husband.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yearwood <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/music/bonus-mom-trisha-yearwood-opens-up-about-being-a-stepmother-to-garth-brooks-3-daughters/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told People</a> that Brooks’ three daughters had to approve of her before the marriage took place. “I’m ‘bonus’ mom,” Yearwood says of her relationship with the now-grown women. “Garth gave me good advice in the beginning: Don’t try to be their mom and don’t try to be their best friend, you’ll find your way. And I think I did with each of them. They’re just lovely young women.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Brooks and Yearwood returned to performing, they ensured they toured together as often as possible. The secret to the success of their marriage is staying true to the pact of being physically present. “We do date nights, but honestly, we are apart maybe five days a year,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/trisha-yearwood-garth-brooks-only-spend-5-days-a-year-apart/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yearwood told Us Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Yearwood told Us Weekly</a> in 2019. “We really have made a conscious effort since getting married to not be apart, so we’ve toured together.
