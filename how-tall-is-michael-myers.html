But come on, who doesn’t absolutely drool over a tall and lanky horror icon? Especially one as dreamy as Michael. Plus, he’s easily <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the sexist baddies</a> in horror history. That’s right, I said it.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>The answer to Michael’s exact height is not necessarily exact at all. In fact, it’s entirely dependent on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which timeline you’re following</a>, and which movie you’re specifically wondering about. In the case of the original Halloween from 1978, The Shape stood at 5’10” thanks to actor Nick Castle portraying him.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>On that same note, actor Tony Moran, who portrayed Michael while he was unmasked in John Carpenter’s original, stands at 6 feet.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>But while nearing 6 feet as a horror villain is terrifying enough, perhaps no other actor portrayed Michael in such a fear-inducing way like actor Tyler Mane. He notably played The Shape in Rob Zombie’s controversial remakes. As the tallest Michael out of the bunch, Mane stands at 6’9”, making that version of Michael Myers the most threatening of them all.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the updated trilogy</a>, Nick Castle briefly portrayed Michael again in David Gordon Green’s Halloween films. That being said, a fresh-faced Michael actor was also introduced into the equation — and that would be James Jude Courtney.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Standing at 6’3″, Courtney established his status as one of the tallest Michaels to exist and certainly one of the most brutal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXamurbiMoqpmpZmYtaKxy2aksp2iqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chippewa-valley-school-district.html><span>←</span><span>Chippewa Valley High School - Clinton Township</span></a>
