<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Many Outlets On The Internet Assume That Awonuga Is The Mother Of Zlatan Ibiles Child</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Zlatan Ibile</strong> whose true name is Omoniyi Temidayo Raphael is now a parent. His kid, junior Zlatan, has recently regularly graced the Zanku Dance creator’s Instagram profile.&nbsp;While the renowned rapper seems to be enjoying his job as a parent, the internet has been speculating about the Afrobeats musician’s partner and his baby mom – all of which sounds inconsistent to say the least.</p><p>While social media has revealed that the Nigerian rapper’s baby mama is UK-born cosmetics artist Devita, other online publications believe Zlatan’s manager, Seyi Awonuga, is his long-time girlfriend and the newborn’s mother, potentially even his wife.&nbsp;It’s definitely perplexing, but don’t fret as we attempt to throw light on this tangled web of competing claims.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zlatan-son></span>Zlatan Son<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On March 29, 2020, the Nigerian native gave birth to his son. However, he did not make the news public until May 2020, when he posted it on Instagram.&nbsp;Zlatan disclosed the baby’s name, Toluwalase Shiloh Ainoghena Omoniyi when confirming his son’s birth. The new father is clearly overjoyed with the birth of his first kid, as he has tattooed Toluwalase’s name on his forearm.</p><p>The delighted father is smitten with tiny Toluwalase and often posts images of him on Instagram. In one of the most recent pictures, dated December 21, 2020, little Toluwalase can be seen standing on his father’s knee, having “a man to man discussion,” as Zlatan puts it.&nbsp;We’re just hanging here having a man-to-man conversation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=many-media-outlets-have-reported-on-his-relationship-with-manager-seyi-awonuga></span>Many media outlets have reported on his relationship with manager Seyi Awonuga.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Awonuga, the manager of the Zanku dance routine’s originator, uploaded a photo of herself with a newborn on Instagram on June 14, 2019. Surprisingly, the caption was simply “Zlatan’s baby.”&nbsp;However, no information about the baby’s mother was provided in the post.<br>Because of this misunderstanding, several media sources on the internet assumed that Awonuga is both the mother of Zlatan’s kid and his wife.&nbsp;Some have speculated that the manager is the indigenous rapper’s long-term lover. She is also known as Zlatan’s manager, although the two are said to have had more than a business connection.&nbsp;Having said that, both of them have remained silent regarding the rumors and theories surrounding their alleged prior connection.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-is-in-a-relationship-with-davita-a-make-up-artist></span>He is in a relationship with Davita, a make-up artist.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On an Instagram image on December 25, 2020, the famed Lagos Anthem singer can be seen holding hands with a gorgeous lady, whom we have it on the good word is his current girlfriend, Davita Lamai. Lamai is a Makeup Artist residing in the United Kingdom, and her Instagram profile image as of this writing was of Zlatan’s kid Toluwalase Shiloh. Furthermore, she used her Instagram story to show off a ‘push gift’ from papa Zlatan himself. A push present is a gift given by a partner to the delivering mother, indicating that the makeup artist is, in fact, Zlatan’s baby mom.</p><p>Despite the fact that the narrative is no longer accessible, it gives sufficient proof to put all prior theories and rumors to rest.&nbsp;However, it is unknown if the singer-songwriter and his fiancée have married.&nbsp;According to an internet article, the makeup artist does not subscribe to the outmoded traditional view of marriage and relationships. Not long ago, in response to one of her fans’ remarks that referred to her as “Zlatan’s property,” she responded that she belonged to no one.&nbsp;A few websites have believed that this appropriate response is proof enough to indicate that the two aren’t even together, much alone man and wife.&nbsp;However, marriage does not imply that a woman becomes a man’s property. That’s a quaint concept, and Lamai may likely have the same opinion even after officiating her relationship with Zlatan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zlatans-girlfriend-lamai-is-a-university-graduate></span>Zlatan’s girlfriend&nbsp;Lamai is a university graduate.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamai was a 23-year-old woman who graduated from the University of Kent in November 2019.&nbsp;The singer’s baby mom normally maintains a low profile, with most of her personal information kept confidential. Having said that, she is active on Instagram, where she often provides life updates through stories and posts.&nbsp;@davitalamai is her Instagram handle, and she has over 20,000 followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRo8Zuu9Sto56so2K8r3nToZxmoZ6psrO6xK1kmqujqrqmedOhmK1lkay8r8HGmmSiq12ptaZ5zKiroZ2iYrynedmlmK2ZnmK2o7XLnqpmm5ieuaV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-it-weird-to-bathe-with-your-child.html><span>←</span><span>Is it weird to bathe with your child?</span></a>
