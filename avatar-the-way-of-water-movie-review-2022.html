"Avatar: The Way of Water" struggles to find its footing at first, throwing viewers back into the world of Pandora in a narratively clunky way. One can tell that Cameron really cares most about the world-building mid-section of this film, which is one of his greatest accomplishments, so he rushes through some of the set-ups to get to the good stuff. Before then, we catch up with Jake Sully (<a href=#>Sam Worthington</a>), a human who is now a full-time Na'vi and partners with Neytiri (<a href=#>Zoe Saldana</a>), with whom he has started a family. They have two sons—Neteyam (<a href=#>Jamie Flatters</a>) and Lo'ak (<a href=#>Britain Dalton</a>)—and a daughter named Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), and they are guardians of Kiri (<a href=#>Sigourney Weaver</a>), the offspring of Weaver's character from the first film.</p><p>Family bliss is fractured when the 'sky people' return, including an avatar Na'vi version of one Colonel Miles Quaritch (<a href=#>Stephen Lang</a>), who has come to finish what he started, including vengeance on Jake for the death of his human form. He comes back with a group of former-human-now-Na'vi soldiers who are the film's main antagonists, but not the only ones. "Avatar: The Way of Water" once again casts the military, planet-destroying humans of this universe as its truest villains, but the villains' motives are sometimes a bit hazy. Around halfway through, I realized it's not very clear why Quaritch is so intent on hunting Jake and his family, other than the plot needs it, and Lang is good at playing mad.</p><p>The bulk of "Avatar: The Way of Water" hinges on the same question Sarah Connor asks in the "Terminator" movies—fight or flight for family? Do you run and hide from the powerful enemy to try and stay safe or turn and fight the oppressive evil? At first, Jake takes the former option, leading them to another part of Pandora, where the film opens up via one of Cameron's longtime obsessions: H2O. The aerial acrobatics of the first film are supplanted by underwater ones in a region run by Tonowari (<a href=#>Cliff Curtis</a>), the leader of a clan called the Metkayina. Himself a family man—his wife is played by <a href=#>Kate Winslet</a>—Tonowari is worried about the danger the new Na'vi visitors could bring but can't turn them away. Again, Cameron plays with moral questions about responsibility in the face of a powerful evil, something that recurs in a group of commercial poachers&nbsp;from Earth. They dare&nbsp;to hunt sacred water animals in stunning sequences during which you have to remind yourself that none of what you're watching is real.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46arZqskad6tbTEZq6asV2ks27DwK2cq2WdpMOqsYyrnK%2Bhlax6c3yRaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./an-honest-review-of-trader-joes-corn-ribs.html><span>←</span><span>An Honest Review of the Trader Joe's Corn Ribs</span></a>
