Answer
If you don’t have access to a stud finder, there are a variety of other ways that may be used to locate studs. When a house is being built, the wall studs are often placed 16 or 24 inches apart from one another. If you start in a corner and measure out 16 inches and don’t find a stud, you should be able to locate one at 24 inches if you start in a corner and measure out 16 inches.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Corsair HX850 80Plus Platinum PSU Review</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>
